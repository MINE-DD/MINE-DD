The hottest periods of the year were labeled \u201cSummer\u201d and the coldest peri- ods \u201cWinter\u201d when those terms are used in the region; otherwise, the labels \u201cHot\u201d and \u201cCool\u201d were assigned. season labels are internally consistent within a site (e.g., \u201cSummer\u201d is always hotter than \u201cWinter\u201d at a site), but not across sites (\u201cSummer\u201d at one site might be cooler than \u201cSummer\u201d at another)"
