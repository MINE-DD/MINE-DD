      "Content: spread rapidly with little or no contact between the various groups. Bishop proposes that the explanation for these patterns might lie in the airborne spread of aerosolized particles that are ingested, rather than through respiratory tract infections.6  We speculate that the airborne component of rotavirus transmission might be responsible for the seasonal pattern of rotavirus disease. A relative drop in humidity and rainfall combined with drying of soils in higher temperatures might increase the aerial transport of dried, contaminated fecal material (in the form of droplet nuclei), and might also lead to increased formation of dust, which could provide a substrate for the virus particles. Increased burning of organic materials during the dry season may also increase the amount of particulates in the air. Airborne particles could settle out and infect water supplies or environmental surfaces, or could be ingested. Particles carried on fomites such as clothing could also play a role in large-scale dispersal of rotavirus organisms.  Some mechanical force would likely be required for aerosolization to occur, and wind might play this role, as well as help disperse the particles once formed. In a 4-year study of rotavirus in Pune, India, a tight correlation was seen between number of days with easterly wind and the number of rotavirus diarrhoea cases as functions of time. Further research on the relationship between wind patterns and rotavirus incidence might shed light on this\n",
