Naumova1,2*1Department of Gastrointestinal Sciences, Christian Medical College, Vellore, TN, India2Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Tufts University School of Engineering, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America# Abstract# IntroductioUnderstanding the temporal patterns in disease occurrence is valuable for formulating effective disease preventive programs. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore complex interactions associated with emergence of seasonal patterns of infectious diseases.# MethodsWe used data from 452 children participating in a birth cohort study to assess the seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhea by creating a weekly time series of rotavirus incidence and fitting a Poisson harmonic regression with biannual peaks. Age and cohort effects were adjusted for by including the weekly counts of number of children in the study and the median age of cohort in a given week. Weekly average temperature, humidity and an interaction term to reflect the joint effect of temperature and humidity were included to consider the effects of meteorological variables.# ResultsIn the overall rotavirus time series, two significant peaks within a single year were observed – one in winter and the other in summer. The effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence, showing a strong negative association. Seasonality remained a significant factor, even after adjusting for meteorological parameters, and the age and cohort effects.# ConclusionsThe methodology for assessing seasonality in cohort studies is not yet developed. This is the first attempt to explore seasonal patterns in a cohort study with a dynamic denominator and rapidly changing immune response on individual and group levels, and provides a highly promising approach for a better understanding of the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases, tracking emergence of pathogenic strains and evaluating the efficacy of intervention programs.# CitatioSarkar R, Kang G, Naumova EN (2013) Rotavirus Seasonality and Age Effects in a Birth Cohort Study of Southern India.

A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.Many infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.'"

The time series presented in this study was assembled using de-identified da...\",\"# Adjustment for Age and Cohort EffectsIn cohort studies with staggered enrollment, there are at least three effects that might impact the time series: staggered enrollment, loss to follow-up, and age effect. To address these factors, two additional time series were created: a time series of weekly counts of the number of children (child-weeks of follow-up) in the study and a time series of the median age of children in a given week. Using the weekly counts of children and events (rotavirus diar...\",\"Based on predicted curves, such seasonal increases were observed to repeat at least twice \\u2013 one around week 72 and 84th week and then another around 96th and 108th week. During the peaks of these intervals (81st and 104th week respectively), the predicted rotavirus incidence was found to be 9.9 and 9.1 episodes per 1000 child-weeks respectively; and the median age of the cohort was 32.9 and 55.3 weeks respectively.

Table 1 shows a summary of the results of the reviewed studies. Although there is controversy in the association in the literature, there is evi...\",\"# Precipitation and CryptosporidiosisChanges in precipitation were also related to a higher incidence of cryptosporidiosis. A statistically significant relationship between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis rates was found in the North West region of England (Naumova et al., 2005). The study revealed that there would be a 27% (95% CI 21%\\u201333%) increase in the overall weekly rate of cryptosporidiosis in the region if the cumulative rainfall for the prior week was at its 75th percentile or 22 mm. The ...\",\"# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Variables# 5. DiscussioPrevious studies have shown that weather and climate exert a critical influence on the spatial and temporal range of cryptosporidiosis, and several notable points were concluded from the literature. Most importantly, the results suggest that climate variability (temperature and rainfall) may have played a significant role in the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. Also, the transmission could be either through a direct eff...\",\"Although rainfall plays a role in cryptosporidiosis incidence, temperature affects transmission in several ways. The studies emphasized that as a result of changing climate, temperature is likely to increase cryptosporidiosis incidence (Eze et al., 2014; Hu, Mengersen, Fu, et al., 2010; Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Hu et al., 2007; Kent et al., 2015; Lake et al., 2005, 2008; Lal, Ikeda, et al., 2013; Naumova et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2006). A possible underlying mechanism for the positive ass...\",\"Additionally, periods of heavy rainfall can result in re-mobilization and redistribution of oocysts in sewage/wastewater into the environment. Consequently, it remains a significant independent risk factor that should be examined with the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. Assuming that the predicted climate change occurs, it is suggested that rising temperatures might boost the number of cryptosporidiosis cases. Based on the fact that higher summer temperatures may allow the growth of Cryptosporid...\",\"# Conclusion and RecommendationsAlthough there is significant debate on the link between weather and climate and cryptosporidiosis occurrence, this review summarizes the evidence of the association. The findings in these studies demonstrate the significant role of weather and climate in the transmission of cryptosporidiosis. There seems to be an increasing incidence of cryptosporidiosis, and it is plausible that the changing pattern of climate will lead to a significant increase in the number of...\",\"There are no conflicts of interest.# Authors' ContributioBoth authors contributed equally to this review and approved the version to be published.# Ethical StatementThis review does not contain any studies involving human participants performed by any of the authors.# ORCIDIsotein Adalia Ikiroma: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-1586# ReferencesAbubakar, I., Aliyu, S.

In temperate regions, a peak in rotavirus infections is observed in the colder and drier months of the year. In tropical and subtropical settings as well, the peak of rotavirus infections occurs in cool dry seasons, although the seasonality is less obvious in some developing countries. Therefore, lower air temperature, especially in combination with a dry...\",\"The finding of a negative association between cases of rotavirus diarrhoea and humidity is more consistent with laboratory evidence. Relative humidity may affect the survival of rotaviruses in air and on fomites and environmental surfaces. At low or medium relative humidity (13\\u201355 %), human rotavirus can remain viable on plastic, glass, and stainless steel for more than 10 days at room temperature. Raising the relative humidity to 80 % results in a rapid loss of infectivity. Survival of human ro...\",\"Survival of rotavirus in water has also been investigated. Simian rotavirus SA-11 was shown to survive in experimentally contaminated fresh and estuarine waters for several days at 20\\u00b0C, especially in water heavily polluted with sewage. Studies with rotavirus isolated from humans showed survival for several weeks at either 20\\u00b0C or 4\\u00b0C in river water.

This does not mean that these factors can explain the usual seasonal patterns themselves. The transmission of rotavirus is complex and multifactorial, involving both host and environmental factors.

There was only a slight seasonal pattern visible in our data, with a relatively small increased risk for giardiasis in autumn (RR 1.17).

Cases in 2011 were 45% above 2004 figures and 3% above 2010 figures. The cases rose from 33,280 in 1989 to a peak of 58,235 in 2000 before dropping to 44,544 in 2004 and rising to a maximum of 64,582 in 2011 (2011 data provisional).There was a marked long-term increase in the percentage of cases in people older than 50 years, with a decline in the incidence in babies and ch...\",\"# Review of a Million Campylobacter Cases# Age DistributioThere were 14% more reported Campylobacter cases in men than in women and a 1.14 M/F ratio across most ages. This was mirrored by the age-specific prevalence, which showed a 30% higher prevalence in men compared with women across most age groups. The age distribution varied geographically, with London having more infections in young adults and less in people older than 40 years. The age distribution of travel-related cases showed lower ra...\",\"# Weekends, Bank Holidays, and Other HolidaysThe onset date was not reported for most Campylobacter infections; the specimen date was recorded in surveillance.

The possible underlying causes of the different directions of association between the two cities might include the different l...\",\"Weekly disease surveillance data rather than monthly data were used in this study and it was an appropriate choice. Monthly data might not be able to provide up-to-date information for food-borne disease, and would be less sensitive in detecting any climate impacts. Daily data were too scarce to run appropriate analyses. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of weekly data in similar studies.# Table 4: Parameters Estimated by Time-Series Adjusted Poisson Model I for Campylobacter Infections i...\",\"Limitations of this study should be acknowledged. Underreporting of food-borne diseases is inevitable in any infectious disease surveillance system, but there is no reason to suspect that this introduces any systematic biases because it is believed that underreporting was consistent over the study period. In addition, further studies including more local influencing factors, such as socio-economic status and public health services, would be important to fully understand the causes of the various...\",\"In conclusion, the seasonal distribution of Campylobacter infections in the Australian cities studied is different. After controlling for seasonality, this study indicates that temperature could be an environmental factor that affects the transmission of Campylobacter infections, although the direction of the association could be different depending on climatic region. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the relationship.# Conflict of InterestThere has been no conflict of interest ...\",\"# Global Seasonality of Rotavirus Diseasebody h1, h2, # Global Seasonality of Rotavirus DiseaseManish M.

One study in the US, with a budget of $300 K, led to a program in which 14,062 people participated with a reduction in disease risk of 12.8% [49]. The benefits of this level of prevention were considered sufficient to outweigh the costs. However, the practicality of behavioural interventions at anything other than the small scale probably means they are impractical given the sizeable disease burden and the lack of efficacy suggested by our analyses.# C...\",\"# AppendixSee Table 1.# Research Paper - Sources of Data for Microsimulation Modelbody h1, h2, table th, td th # Sources of Data Used for Parameterisation of Microsimulation ModelReference numbers refer to the main text.|Parameter|Range or Type of Values|Source| |||| |a.

Sources of human exposure include contaminated food and water, contact with animals and/or their faeces, and contact with infected individuals. The objectives of this study were to: (a) identify environmental conditions associated with the occurrence of Campylobacter in humans in four regions of Ontario, and (b) identify pooled measures of effect across all four regions and potential sources of heterogeneity. Methods: To address objective 1, human Campylobacter cases from four health regions of Ontario, Canada were analysed using negative binomial regression and case cross-over analysis to identify relationships between environmental factors (temperature, precipitation and hydrology of the local watershed) and the risk of human infection. To address objective 2, meta-analytic models were used to explore pooled measures of effect and when appropriate, meta-regression models were used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Results: Human incidence exhibited strong seasonality with cases peaking in the late spring and summer. There was a decreasing yearly effect in three of the four health regions. A significant pooled effect was found for mean temperature after a 1-week lag (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02, 1.04). No significant pooled effects were found for precipitation or water flow. However, increased precipitation was associated with lower odds of campylobacteriosis in Wellington and York regions at 2- and 3-week lags, respectively, from the case cross-over analysis. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that a climatic factor (specifically, mean temperature in the week prior) was associated with human case occurrence after a biologically plausible time period, but hydrologic factors are not. K E Y W O R D S: campylobacteriosis, case cross-over, environment, meta-analysis, seasonality # 1 | INTRODUCTION Campylobacteriosis is a bacterial enteric illness characterized by fever, abdominal pain, inflammation and diarrhoea with potential mucus or blood in the stool after a 2- to 5-day incubation period (Epps et al., 2013; Young, Davis, & Dirita, 2007). An uncommon, but severe, chronic sequelae of campylobacteriosis is Guillian Barre syndrome, a neurological syndrome that can lead to respiratory paralysis (Baker et al., 2012). Between 2007 and 2009, there were 10,916 reported cases of campylobacteriosis in Ontario resulting in a rate of 28.3 cases per 100,000 population (Vrbova, Johnson, ...

      "Document 936: # 3 Results # 3.1 Descriptive Statistics There were a total of 5,675 human cases in the four health regions (Table 2) from 1 January 2005 to 31 January 2014. There were more cases in males (55.2%) than females (44.8%). Most of the cases occurred in the 2029 age group (17.4%) and in those under 10 years of age (14.4%, Figure S1). # Table 2: The total number of reported Campylobacter cases between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2014 in each of the four health regions broken down by sex |Health Region|Females Cases (%)|Males Cases (%)|Total Cases| ||||| |Waterloo (1)|532 (46.3)|616 (53.7)|1,148| |WellingtonDufferinGuelph (2)|328 (43.0)|435 (57.0)|763| |York (3)|1,162 (44.6)|1,446 (55.4)|2,608| |Durham (4)|519 (44.9)|637 (55.1)|1,156| |Total|2,541 (44.8)|3,134 (55.2)|5,675| These data are as documented in the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHiS) for the Province of Ontario.# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis body  h1, h2,  table  th, td  th   # Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis # 3.2 Seasonality For human cases in the Waterloo, WellingtonDufferinGuelph, York and Durham health regions, there was a distinct seasonal trend, with most cases occurring from June to September (p < .05 for the combined sine and cosine terms, pictured in Figure 2). The yearly trend was significant in two of the four health regions, showing that cases were decreasing over time in Waterloo (coefficient = 0.940, 95% CI: 0.9030.979, p = .003) and York (coefficient = 0.934, 95% CI: 0.9230.955, p < .0001) health regions. However, in the other two health regions examined (Wellington and Durham), there was no year over year change in the observed pattern of cases. The direction and magnitude of effects varied across health regions. In the univariable analysis, increased mean temperature was associated with increased odds of campylobacteriosis after a 1-week lag in the WellingtonDufferinGuelph health region, at 1-, 3-, and 4-week lags in the York region, and at 1- and 4-week lags in the Durham region (Table S1). Increased precipitation was associated with lower odds of campylobacteriosis in Wellington and York regions at 2- and 3-week lags, respectively (Table S1). Increased water flow was not statistically significant in any of the health regions at any lag (Table S1). Odds ratios from the multivariable conditional regression models that included all exposures (Table S2) were carried forward into the meta-analytic analysis. # 3.3 Case Cross-Over Analysis Univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression models were created for each health region with the exposure variables of mean temperature, total precipitation and water flow at all time lags. # 3.4 Meta-Analysis Based on the pooled effect size, mean temperature was associated with increased odds of campylobacteriosis at a 1-week lag (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02, 1.04) and was homogenous across regions. # Figure 2: Average incidence of Campylobacter per 100,000 population by month The data span 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2013 and is separated by health region.

There are two species of Cryptosporidium that most affect humans, C. hominis and C. parvum. The host reservoir for C. hominis is humans, while the host reservoirs for C. parvum are cattle, livestock, and humans. Studies have reported differing geographical ranges for the two species, and findings regarding differences between the species are fairly recent.\n",
