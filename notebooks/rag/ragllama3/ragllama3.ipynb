A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\\n\\nMany infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.\\n\\nPeriodic fluctuations can be successfully detected and modeled using statistical methods, which allows us to describe and compare seasonal characteristics: amplitude, peaks and troughs. An analysis of seasonality has to be performed on a sufficiently long time series to be able to capture many occurrences of seasonal increases. Thus, by abstracting records from large databases of medical records, including laboratory tests, hospitalizations and mortality records, long time series can be successfully compiled to provide the foundation for reliable assessment of disease seasonality. However, each data source might contain only a fraction of all events associated with infection and sometimes may offer biased reflection of a true incidence of infection in a community.\\n\\nWhile surveillance systems are an excellent source of data to study seasonality in a general population, they might not be ideal for tracking unique features of specific diseases. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore intricate details associated.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.ethics, .data-sources, .compilation, .adjustment, .assessment {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\nborder-left: 4px solid #007BFF;\\npadding-left: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nWith the emergence of seasonal patterns, longitudinal tracking of disease occurrence in each subject allows for the detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, complete genotyping, and comparison of observed strains in the same individual. This also links disease profiles to environmental, social, and genetic features.\\n\\nHowever, the specific features of cohort studies—such as staggered enrollment, age effects, and short follow-up periods—present substantial methodological challenges for seasonality analysis. Current analytical approaches for assessing seasonality are best suited for long time series with relatively stable populations and usually when the patterns of disease have a stable structure. It is useful to expand the methodology of seasonality analysis to this promising study design, which has already demonstrated advantages in understanding the natural history of viral and protozoan infections.\\n\\nRotavirus infection is a leading cause of morbidity in developing countries, and currently, there are a number of suitable vaccines. In temperate areas, the seasonality of rotavirus infection with a single winter peak is well documented. In tropical climates, its seasonality is less defined; however, sometimes an increase is noticed during cold and dry periods. Occasionally, two peaks within a single year are reported: one in winter and one in summer. The burden of rotavirus diarrhea is highest among very young children and decreases rapidly thereafter, which can introduce a strong age effect in the assessment of any temporal pattern.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Ethics Statement\\n\\nThis paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis from a birth cohort study in southern India, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of the participating children prior to enrollment, which also included permission to use the data for future research purposes. The time series presented in this study was assembled using de-identified data.\\n\\n# Data Sources\\n\\nWe used data from a birth cohort study on the natural history of rotavirus infection in Vellore, south India. In this study, a total of 452 children were recruited between March 2002 and August 2003 and followed up for a period of 3 years; a total of 373 (80%) children completed the follow-up period. Each child was subjected to a biweekly follow-up schedule to record diarrheal and other morbidities during the preceding days. Surveillance stool samples were collected every 2 weeks, and up to 3 diarrheal stool samples were collected every time the child had diarrhea. The stool samples were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA and PCR-based methods. The details of symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections over the 3-year period among the 373 children who completed the study have been reported elsewhere.\\n\\nData from all 452 children enrolled in this study was used to illustrate the seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in this cohort. We defined a diarrheal episode to be associated with rotavirus if one or more stool samples collected within 67 days of that episode was positive for rotavirus by PCR. Using this definition, we identified a total of 291 episodes of PCR-positive rotavirus diarrhea among the 452 children in this cohort. We also explored the effect of different rotavirus genotypes in the overall seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea among the study children.\\n\\nDaily data on ambient temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall for Vellore for the study period was obtained from the Regional Meteorological Office in Chennai, India. Average weekly temperature and humidity readings were then computed for the duration of the time series. The total volume of rainfall for a particular week was calculated using the daily rainfall measurements.\\n\\n# Compilation of Time Series\\n\\nAll samples tested for rotavirus contained the date of sample collection; thus, the created time series was 100% complete. Seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by aggregating the daily surveillance data into a weekly time-series of counts. Diarrheal episodes were assigned to the week corresponding to the first day of that episode. A week was defined as seven consecutive days from Sunday to Saturday, irrespective of any overlap between two calendar years. The first week of January 2002 was considered to be the first week of the time-series. Hence, for this study, the week-series commenced from March 10, 2002, and ended on the 243rd week, week ending August 31, 2006, for a total of 234 weeks.\\n\\n# Adjustment for Age and Cohort Effects\\n\\nIn cohort studies with staggered enrollment, there are at least three effects that might impact the time series: staggered enrollment, loss to follow-up, and age effect. To address these factors, two additional time series were created: a time series of weekly counts of the number of children (child-weeks of follow-up) in the study and a time series of the median age of children in a given week. Using the weekly counts of children and events (rotavirus diarrhea), incidence rates per 1000 child-weeks of follow-up were calculated. Therefore, the assessment of seasonality was based on the weekly incidence rates, adjusting for the aging in the cohort.\\n\\n# Assessment of Seasonality\\n\\nThe seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by fitting a Poisson harmonic regression (PHM) as a generalized linear model (GLM) considering two annual humps, which were accommodated by including four sine-cosine terms. To adjust for the cohort effect, we expanded the regression model by including child-weeks of follow-up as a linear term. The age effect of rotavirus diarrhea was explored by applying three different models: first using a linear term representing the median age of the cohort for the corresponding week, second by adding a quadratic term for the weekly median age to the linear term, and third by replacing the linear and quadratic terms by adding an exponential term representing the log-transformed median age of the cohort. Based on overall model performance and results interpretation, a linear term to represent the effect of age was selected. Finally, to consider the effects of meteorological variables, variables for weekly average temperature, humidity, and an interaction term were included to reflect the joint effect of temperature and humidity.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid black;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nThe sequentially-built final model can thus be depicted as below: incidence of 27.8 episodes per 1000 child-weeks. The predicted incidence from the model was 15.7 episodes per 1000 child-weeks.\\n\\nLog(E½Y) ~ b0 + b1 sin(2πvt) + b2 cos(2πvt) + b3 sin(4πvt) + b4 cos(4πvt) + b5 nt + b6 a + b7 T + b8 P + b9 TP + et, where t is time in weeks, v is frequency of 52.25, Yt is a time-series of incidence, nt is a term for weekly value of child-weeks of follow-up; at is a median age for a cohort at t-week, thus the regression parameter b6 reflects the change in the incidence associated with 1 week; T, P, and TP are values for weekly average temperature, humidity and their cross-product interaction, respectively; b are regression parameters, e is the error term. Using b6 we estimate the age effect as follows: d = 1 - exp{52.25b6}, where d is the percent reduction in the incidence over one year. In this model, parameters b1 through b4 refer to seasonal harmonics.\\n\\nBased on predicted curves, such seasonal increases were observed to repeat at least twice – one around week 72 and 84th week and then another around 96th and 108th week. During the peaks of these intervals (81st and 104th week respectively), the predicted rotavirus incidence was found to be 9.9 and 9.1 episodes per 1000 child-weeks respectively; and the median age of the cohort was 32.9 and 55.3 weeks respectively. A smaller hump was also observed at the inception of the study, peaking at the 25th week when the first 68 children were enrolled. The median age of the cohort at this time was 6 weeks, thereby indicating neonatal and early childhood infections.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe cumulative weekly distribution and the relative contribution of the different rotavirus genotypes are presented in Figure 4. Visualization of these data suggests clustering of rotavirus genotypes at certain time points. For example, rotavirus G1P [8] was the predominant circulating genotype between the 52nd and 67th weeks, whereas between the 103rd and 116th week, G2P [4] was found to be more common. As observed in Figure 3, the second peak of rotavirus diarrhea seems to be driven primarily by the G1P [8] genotype, whereas the fourth peak was mostly driven by G2P [4]. Interestingly, the third peak observed in Figure 3 (81st week) seems to be driven at least partially by G1P [4] and the untypable or partially typable rotavirus genotypes.\\n\\nThe weekly counts of detected rotavirus diarrhea (total 291 episodes) are plotted in a form of a needle-plot and presented in Figure 1. The time series (see Dataset S1) started from week 10, which refers to the beginning of enrollment. The observed average (95% CI) weekly incidence of rotavirus diarrhea was 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks. As expected, the initial weeks of the study had low counts of rotavirus diarrhea due to continuing enrollment. The highest count of rotavirus diarrhea was observed on the 73rd week of the study, which coincides with the end of the enrollment period.\\n\\nThe enrollment scheme is presented in Figure 2, which reflects three segments with characteristic features. Between the 10th and 84th week a steady increase is observed in the child-weeks of follow-up depicting the ongoing enrollment process; between the 84th and 204th week, a practically flat line in the child-weeks of follow-up was observed that denoted the time period when most of the children were being followed-up; thereafter, between 204 and 243rd a rapid decline was observed because of children completing the study. The ageing of the cohort is depicted in Figure 2 as a dashed line.\\n\\nOver the course of the study, the effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence. In one year, a significant reduction of 62.9, 66.6, 60.9, 71.5 percent was observed in the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea and three major genotypes, G1P [8], G2P [4], and G1P [4], respectively (p < 0.0001, see Table 1). The age-specific decline explained 32.1% of the variation in the incidence of rotavirus overall, whereas the seasonality and meteorological factors explained 6.1% of the overall model variation.\\n\\nThe overall rotavirus incidence and for the individual strains assessed, the seasonality remained significant after adjusting for meteorological parameters, and the age and cohort effects. The highest seasonal increase in rotavirus incidence was observed between the 41st and 66th weeks of the study, coinciding with the major bulk of rotavirus diarrhea counts among the study children. This wave peaked at the 54th week when a total of 7 episodes of rotavirus diarrhea were observed over 251.4 child-weeks of follow-up.\\n\\n**Table 1: Model Parameters and Goodness of Fit**\\n|Parameter|Value|\\n|---|---|\\n|b0|Value|\\n|b1|Value|\\n|b2|Value|\\n|b3|Value|\\n|b4|Value|\\n|b5|Value|\\n|b6|Value|\\n|b7|Value|\\n|b8|Value|\\n|b9|Value|\\n|Goodness of Fit|Value|\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\n#\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\n# Figures\\n\\nFigure 1.

We adjusted for age and cohort effects, and assessed the seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhea overall and that of three most common genotypes using a Poisson harmonic regression model. After adjusting for strong age effect, seasonal fluctuations remained significant with biannual peaks, 6 months apart. The most pronounced peak was observed during the first winter in the life of the newborn at an average age of about 4 months.\\n\\nBirth cohort studies offer an unbiased approach to examine the relationship between time of birth and susceptibility to infections and have substantial advantages in tracking unique features of specific diseases such as rotavirus where the incidence of symptomatic disease is heavily shifted towards the first few years of life and then diminishes rapidly. It also allows careful tracking of age effects and changes in immunity, and frequency and routes of exposure due to changes during child development including feeding patterns, introduction of weaning foods and changes in hygiene practices.\\n\\nA strong age effect was noticed in this study, with the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea decreasing steadily with increasing age. This is possibly due to the development of protective immunity to rotavirus, which prevented children from developing symptomatic infections at an older age. Natural rotavirus infection has been shown to confer protection against subsequent infection and disease [27,28]. Despite this strong age effect, the detection of seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of rotavirus infection is, on its own, remarkable.\\n\\nThe temporal clustering of the circulating rotavirus genotypes, even within a relatively short time series (Figure 4) was another important finding of this study, and is possibly a result of immune selection pressure. Also, the strain-specific variations in the seasonality of rotavirus observed in this study suggest that the seasonality of rotavirus may be strain-dependent. Therefore, in future studies, including data on the circulating rotavirus genotypes may provide a more robust estimate of the seasonality of rotavirus infection.\\n\\nIt has previously been observed that in temperate climates, the season of birth can adversely affect rotavirus diarrhea and children born in summer have a higher risk of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection that typically peaked in winter [29]. However, unlike in temperate climates, in this study two seasonal peaks of rotavirus diarrhea, 6-months apart, were observed which suggests that children in tropical climates may have the same risk of exposure to the virus, irrespective of their birth season. The staggered enrollment lasted for over one year (Figure 2), thereby enabling children born at different seasons to be equally represented in this study. Hence, it can reasonably be assumed that the effect of seasonality observed in this study was independent of their birth season.\\n\\nCohort studies with an intensive follow-up are difficult to replicate and such in-depth evaluation can be available only for a limited time period, small geographic area and relatively small sample size.

The observation of biannual peaks agrees with other studies of rotavirus in tropical climates [17,30,31,32,33]. Published data also provide an illustration of biannual peaks [17].\\n\\nIn a cross-sectional study in Dhaka, a total of 10,739 stool samples from patients admitted between January 2001 to May 2006 in the ICDDR,B hospital were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA-based methods, of which 2706 (25.2%) were found to be positive. A large proportion (>90%) of the rotavirus positive patients were children below the age of 2 years.\\n\\nApplying the harmonic regression model presented in this study, a predictive curve was produced that accounted for 80% of variability in the monthly time series of the proportion of rotavirus positive stool samples (see Figure 6). Although the shift to more severe cases due to differences in patient profiles has to be taken into account while comparing cohort data with community or hospital-based surveillance systems [24], this similarity of biannual peaks observed in the large surveillance sample and our relatively small cohort is encouraging.\\n\\n# Figure 6\\n\\nSeasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2001–2006) with pronounced biannual peaks.

The majority of studies on rotavirus diarrhea are hospital-based cross-sectional studies. From these studies, the prevalence of rotavirus among hospitalized children was found to be significant.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org | August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71616\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .author-contributions {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nTo range from 19.2–49.9% (average 33.6%). The proportion of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus was, however, much lower at 12% (range 7.1–15.5%) in outpatient settings. Converting our observed weekly incidence of 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks to an annual incidence would have resulted in an average (95% CI) of 0.22 (0.19–0.27) episodes of rotavirus diarrhea per child per year. This is comparable to the rotavirus diarrheal incidence of 0.16 (0.10–0.22) episodes per child-year among <2-year old children in an urban slum in Delhi.\\n\\nWhile birth cohort studies provide highly valuable information to close critical gaps in understanding disease burden, the design of such studies should be also explored as a working platform for investigating the emergence of novel pathogens and strains. In this study, a large number of untypable samples occurred before the switch to another type. Their disproportional increase might indicate the appearance of a new strain previously unknown and not seen for a period of time and not considered for typing. Using a wide range of information sources through triangulation and integration of epidemiological cohorts, surveillance systems, hospitalization records, and outpatient follow-up is a highly promising approach for a better understanding of the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases, tracking the emergence of pathogenic strains, and evaluating the efficacy of intervention programs.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- Dataset S1: Time series of selected variables presented in the study.

A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\\n\\nMany infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population.

      "Understanding the temporal patterns in disease occurrence is valuable for formulating effective disease preventive programs. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore complex interactions associated with emergence of seasonal patterns of infectious diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "We used data from 452 children participating in a birth cohort study to assess the seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhea by creating a weekly time series of rotavirus incidence and fitting a Poisson harmonic regression with biannual peaks. Age and cohort effects were adjusted for by including the weekly counts of number of children in the study and the median age of cohort in a given week. Weekly average temperature, humidity and an interaction term to reflect the joint effect of temperature and humidity were included to consider the effects of meteorological variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Results\n",
      "\n",
      "In the overall rotavirus time series, two significant peaks within a single year were observed – one in winter and the other in summer. The effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence, showing a strong negative association. Seasonality remained a significant factor, even after adjusting for meteorological parameters, and the age and cohort effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology for assessing seasonality in cohort studies is not yet developed. This is the first attempt to explore seasonal patterns in a cohort study with a dynamic denominator and rapidly changing immune response on individual and group levels, and provides a highly promising approach for a better understanding of the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases, tracking emergence of pathogenic strains and evaluating the efficacy of intervention programs.\n",

      "# Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "World-wide expansions of public health surveillance, long-term maintenance of patient electronic records and digital disease detection have invigorated attention to seasonal fluctuations in infectious diseases. A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.\n",

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

By linking local weather conditions to pathogen prevalence, we aim to reveal site-specific seasons associated with these pathogens.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThe data from GEMS provides a unique opportunity to compare the seasonality of multiple pathogens across different countries through a coordinated study. We employ traditional signal processing analysis methods, such as the Lomb–Scargle periodogram and Fast Fourier transforms, to detect periodicity in time series data.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# GEMS Data\\n\\nThe Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) was conducted over 36 months from December 2007 to March 2011 across seven communities in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Children aged 0–59 months with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) were eligible for enrollment.\\n\\nTo be included, a child's diarrhea episode had to be new, acute, and meet at least one clinical criterion for MSD. Clinical criteria included signs of dehydration, dysentery, or hospitalization due to diarrhea. A total of 9,439 out of 14,753 eligible children were enrolled during the study period.\\n\\nOur analysis focused on pathogens associated with the majority of diarrheal illnesses in GEMS, including rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, Shigella spp., typical EPEC, and ST-ETEC.

Because different pathogens were associated with different seasons, the relative prevalence (and ranking) of pathogens among children with MSD differed by season. Among children 0 to 23 months old, rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently detected among eligible children in the winter, dry, or cool/dry seasons at all sites (22–57% of cases, Fig 6, left panel). In the rainy or monsoon months, rotavirus was less dominant, and Shigella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the most often detected. Among those 24 to 59 months old, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen at three of the seven sites in winter or cool/dry seasons (Fig 6, right panel). For these older children, V. cholerae is one of the top three pathogens at some sites during the monsoon or summer seasons.\\n\\n# Impact of Birth Month on Diarrheal Illness\\n\\nAnnual cycles indicate a birth month is a risk factor for diarrheal illness. If MSD or pathogen associated with MSD has a highly significant annual period, the age at which a child is most likely to get diarrhea depends on the birth month of a child. For example, if diarrheal disease peaks in the first quarter of the year, a child born in the second quarter might not be at high risk until six to nine months of age, while a child born before the first quarter may be at higher risk.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nFig 5.

A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD).

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

Because different pathogens were associated with different seasons, the relative prevalence (and ranking) of pathogens among children with MSD differed by season. Among children 0 to 23 months old, rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently detected among eligible children in the winter, dry, or cool/dry seasons at all sites (22–57% of cases, Fig 6, left panel). In the rainy or monsoon months, rotavirus was less dominant, and Shigella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the most often detected. Among those 24 to 59 months old, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen at three of the seven sites in winter or cool/dry seasons (Fig 6, right panel). For these older children, V. cholerae is one of the top three pathogens at some sites during the monsoon or summer seasons.\\n\\n# Impact of Birth Month on Diarrheal Illness\\n\\nAnnual cycles indicate a birth month is a risk factor for diarrheal illness. If MSD or pathogen associated with MSD has a highly significant annual period, the age at which a child is most likely to get diarrhea depends on the birth month of a child. For example, if diarrheal disease peaks in the first quarter of the year, a child born in the second quarter might not be at high risk until six to nine months of age, while a child born before the first quarter may be at higher risk.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nFig 5.

Note that the seasons are not plotted in a particular order and may be non-sequential.\\n\\nThis research aims to better understand the seasonality of the most important diarrhea-associated pathogens as well as the relationship of prevalence to site-specific environmental weather variables. We utilize standard mathematical methodologies to test for seasonality as well as more modern machine-learning algorithms to identify data-driven seasons from detailed environmental data to correlate with the periodicity of pathogen incidence. This work provides a unique perspective on characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of diarrheal pathogens due to the diversity of study sites in resource-constrained settings, consistent study protocol, and large sample size.\\n\\nRotavirus was the only pathogen with highly significant annual prevalence peaks at most of the study sites.

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

Because different pathogens were associated with different seasons, the relative prevalence (and ranking) of pathogens among children with MSD differed by season. Among children 0 to 23 months old, rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently detected among eligible children in the winter, dry, or cool/dry seasons at all sites (22–57% of cases, Fig 6, left panel). In the rainy or monsoon months, rotavirus was less dominant, and Shigella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the most often detected. Among those 24 to 59 months old, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen at three of the seven sites in winter or cool/dry seasons (Fig 6, right panel). For these older children, V. cholerae is one of the top three pathogens at some sites during the monsoon or summer seasons.\\n\\n# Impact of Birth Month on Diarrheal Illness\\n\\nAnnual cycles indicate a birth month is a risk factor for diarrheal illness. If MSD or pathogen associated with MSD has a highly significant annual period, the age at which a child is most likely to get diarrhea depends on the birth month of a child. For example, if diarrheal disease peaks in the first quarter of the year, a child born in the second quarter might not be at high risk until six to nine months of age, while a child born before the first quarter may be at higher risk.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nFig 5.

The top three pathogens by season. For each country, the top three most frequently detected pathogens (out of the nine considered) among eligible children ages 0 to 23 months (left half of the plot) and 24 to 59 months old (right half) are shown. Bar heights are proportional to the percent of cases positive for a pathogen (which is also printed below each bar), and the pathogens are indicated by abbreviations and color as summarized in the legend. Pathogens considered are: rotavirus, adenovirus 40/41, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, Cryptosporidium, Shigella, ST-ETEC, Campylobacter, and V. cholerae. Note that the seasons are not plotted in a particular order and may be non-sequential.\\n\\nThis research aims to better understand the seasonality of the most important diarrhea-associated pathogens as well as the relationship of prevalence to site-specific environmental weather variables. We utilize standard mathematical methodologies to test for seasonality as well as more modern machine-learning algorithms to identify data-driven seasons from detailed environmental data to correlate with the periodicity of pathogen incidence. This work provides a unique perspective on characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of diarrheal pathogens due to the diversity of study sites in resource-constrained settings, consistent study protocol, and large sample size.\\n\\nRotavirus was the only pathogen with highly significant annual prevalence peaks at most of the study sites.

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.
