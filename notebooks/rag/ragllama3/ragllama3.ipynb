A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\\n\\nMany infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.\\n\\nPeriodic fluctuations can be successfully detected and modeled using statistical methods, which allows us to describe and compare seasonal characteristics: amplitude, peaks and troughs. An analysis of seasonality has to be performed on a sufficiently long time series to be able to capture many occurrences of seasonal increases. Thus, by abstracting records from large databases of medical records, including laboratory tests, hospitalizations and mortality records, long time series can be successfully compiled to provide the foundation for reliable assessment of disease seasonality. However, each data source might contain only a fraction of all events associated with infection and sometimes may offer biased reflection of a true incidence of infection in a community.\\n\\nWhile surveillance systems are an excellent source of data to study seasonality in a general population, they might not be ideal for tracking unique features of specific diseases. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore intricate details associated.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.ethics, .data-sources, .compilation, .adjustment, .assessment {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\nborder-left: 4px solid #007BFF;\\npadding-left: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nWith the emergence of seasonal patterns, longitudinal tracking of disease occurrence in each subject allows for the detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, complete genotyping, and comparison of observed strains in the same individual. This also links disease profiles to environmental, social, and genetic features.\\n\\nHowever, the specific features of cohort studies—such as staggered enrollment, age effects, and short follow-up periods—present substantial methodological challenges for seasonality analysis. Current analytical approaches for assessing seasonality are best suited for long time series with relatively stable populations and usually when the patterns of disease have a stable structure. It is useful to expand the methodology of seasonality analysis to this promising study design, which has already demonstrated advantages in understanding the natural history of viral and protozoan infections.\\n\\nRotavirus infection is a leading cause of morbidity in developing countries, and currently, there are a number of suitable vaccines. In temperate areas, the seasonality of rotavirus infection with a single winter peak is well documented. In tropical climates, its seasonality is less defined; however, sometimes an increase is noticed during cold and dry periods. Occasionally, two peaks within a single year are reported: one in winter and one in summer. The burden of rotavirus diarrhea is highest among very young children and decreases rapidly thereafter, which can introduce a strong age effect in the assessment of any temporal pattern.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Ethics Statement\\n\\nThis paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis from a birth cohort study in southern India, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of the participating children prior to enrollment, which also included permission to use the data for future research purposes. The time series presented in this study was assembled using de-identified data.\\n\\n# Data Sources\\n\\nWe used data from a birth cohort study on the natural history of rotavirus infection in Vellore, south India. In this study, a total of 452 children were recruited between March 2002 and August 2003 and followed up for a period of 3 years; a total of 373 (80%) children completed the follow-up period. Each child was subjected to a biweekly follow-up schedule to record diarrheal and other morbidities during the preceding days. Surveillance stool samples were collected every 2 weeks, and up to 3 diarrheal stool samples were collected every time the child had diarrhea. The stool samples were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA and PCR-based methods. The details of symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections over the 3-year period among the 373 children who completed the study have been reported elsewhere.\\n\\nData from all 452 children enrolled in this study was used to illustrate the seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in this cohort. We defined a diarrheal episode to be associated with rotavirus if one or more stool samples collected within 67 days of that episode was positive for rotavirus by PCR. Using this definition, we identified a total of 291 episodes of PCR-positive rotavirus diarrhea among the 452 children in this cohort. We also explored the effect of different rotavirus genotypes in the overall seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea among the study children.\\n\\nDaily data on ambient temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall for Vellore for the study period was obtained from the Regional Meteorological Office in Chennai, India. Average weekly temperature and humidity readings were then computed for the duration of the time series. The total volume of rainfall for a particular week was calculated using the daily rainfall measurements.\\n\\n# Compilation of Time Series\\n\\nAll samples tested for rotavirus contained the date of sample collection; thus, the created time series was 100% complete. Seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by aggregating the daily surveillance data into a weekly time-series of counts. Diarrheal episodes were assigned to the week corresponding to the first day of that episode. A week was defined as seven consecutive days from Sunday to Saturday, irrespective of any overlap between two calendar years. The first week of January 2002 was considered to be the first week of the time-series. Hence, for this study, the week-series commenced from March 10, 2002, and ended on the 243rd week, week ending August 31, 2006, for a total of 234 weeks.\\n\\n# Adjustment for Age and Cohort Effects\\n\\nIn cohort studies with staggered enrollment, there are at least three effects that might impact the time series: staggered enrollment, loss to follow-up, and age effect. To address these factors, two additional time series were created: a time series of weekly counts of the number of children (child-weeks of follow-up) in the study and a time series of the median age of children in a given week. Using the weekly counts of children and events (rotavirus diarrhea), incidence rates per 1000 child-weeks of follow-up were calculated. Therefore, the assessment of seasonality was based on the weekly incidence rates, adjusting for the aging in the cohort.\\n\\n# Assessment of Seasonality\\n\\nThe seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by fitting a Poisson harmonic regression (PHM) as a generalized linear model (GLM) considering two annual humps, which were accommodated by including four sine-cosine terms. To adjust for the cohort effect, we expanded the regression model by including child-weeks of follow-up as a linear term. The age effect of rotavirus diarrhea was explored by applying three different models: first using a linear term representing the median age of the cohort for the corresponding week, second by adding a quadratic term for the weekly median age to the linear term, and third by replacing the linear and quadratic terms by adding an exponential term representing the log-transformed median age of the cohort. Based on overall model performance and results interpretation, a linear term to represent the effect of age was selected. Finally, to consider the effects of meteorological variables, variables for weekly average temperature, humidity, and an interaction term were included to reflect the joint effect of temperature and humidity.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid black;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nThe sequentially-built final model can thus be depicted as below: incidence of 27.8 episodes per 1000 child-weeks. The predicted incidence from the model was 15.7 episodes per 1000 child-weeks.\\n\\nLog(E½Y) ~ b0 + b1 sin(2πvt) + b2 cos(2πvt) + b3 sin(4πvt) + b4 cos(4πvt) + b5 nt + b6 a + b7 T + b8 P + b9 TP + et, where t is time in weeks, v is frequency of 52.25, Yt is a time-series of incidence, nt is a term for weekly value of child-weeks of follow-up; at is a median age for a cohort at t-week, thus the regression parameter b6 reflects the change in the incidence associated with 1 week; T, P, and TP are values for weekly average temperature, humidity and their cross-product interaction, respectively; b are regression parameters, e is the error term. Using b6 we estimate the age effect as follows: d = 1 - exp{52.25b6}, where d is the percent reduction in the incidence over one year. In this model, parameters b1 through b4 refer to seasonal harmonics.\\n\\nBased on predicted curves, such seasonal increases were observed to repeat at least twice – one around week 72 and 84th week and then another around 96th and 108th week. During the peaks of these intervals (81st and 104th week respectively), the predicted rotavirus incidence was found to be 9.9 and 9.1 episodes per 1000 child-weeks respectively; and the median age of the cohort was 32.9 and 55.3 weeks respectively. A smaller hump was also observed at the inception of the study, peaking at the 25th week when the first 68 children were enrolled. The median age of the cohort at this time was 6 weeks, thereby indicating neonatal and early childhood infections.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe cumulative weekly distribution and the relative contribution of the different rotavirus genotypes are presented in Figure 4. Visualization of these data suggests clustering of rotavirus genotypes at certain time points. For example, rotavirus G1P [8] was the predominant circulating genotype between the 52nd and 67th weeks, whereas between the 103rd and 116th week, G2P [4] was found to be more common. As observed in Figure 3, the second peak of rotavirus diarrhea seems to be driven primarily by the G1P [8] genotype, whereas the fourth peak was mostly driven by G2P [4]. Interestingly, the third peak observed in Figure 3 (81st week) seems to be driven at least partially by G1P [4] and the untypable or partially typable rotavirus genotypes.\\n\\nThe weekly counts of detected rotavirus diarrhea (total 291 episodes) are plotted in a form of a needle-plot and presented in Figure 1. The time series (see Dataset S1) started from week 10, which refers to the beginning of enrollment. The observed average (95% CI) weekly incidence of rotavirus diarrhea was 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks. As expected, the initial weeks of the study had low counts of rotavirus diarrhea due to continuing enrollment. The highest count of rotavirus diarrhea was observed on the 73rd week of the study, which coincides with the end of the enrollment period.\\n\\nThe enrollment scheme is presented in Figure 2, which reflects three segments with characteristic features. Between the 10th and 84th week a steady increase is observed in the child-weeks of follow-up depicting the ongoing enrollment process; between the 84th and 204th week, a practically flat line in the child-weeks of follow-up was observed that denoted the time period when most of the children were being followed-up; thereafter, between 204 and 243rd a rapid decline was observed because of children completing the study. The ageing of the cohort is depicted in Figure 2 as a dashed line.\\n\\nOver the course of the study, the effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence. In one year, a significant reduction of 62.9, 66.6, 60.9, 71.5 percent was observed in the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea and three major genotypes, G1P [8], G2P [4], and G1P [4], respectively (p < 0.0001, see Table 1). The age-specific decline explained 32.1% of the variation in the incidence of rotavirus overall, whereas the seasonality and meteorological factors explained 6.1% of the overall model variation.\\n\\nThe overall rotavirus incidence and for the individual strains assessed, the seasonality remained significant after adjusting for meteorological parameters, and the age and cohort effects. The highest seasonal increase in rotavirus incidence was observed between the 41st and 66th weeks of the study, coinciding with the major bulk of rotavirus diarrhea counts among the study children. This wave peaked at the 54th week when a total of 7 episodes of rotavirus diarrhea were observed over 251.4 child-weeks of follow-up.\\n\\n**Table 1: Model Parameters and Goodness of Fit**\\n|Parameter|Value|\\n|---|---|\\n|b0|Value|\\n|b1|Value|\\n|b2|Value|\\n|b3|Value|\\n|b4|Value|\\n|b5|Value|\\n|b6|Value|\\n|b7|Value|\\n|b8|Value|\\n|b9|Value|\\n|Goodness of Fit|Value|\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\n#\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\n# Figures\\n\\nFigure 1.

We adjusted for age and cohort effects, and assessed the seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhea overall and that of three most common genotypes using a Poisson harmonic regression model. After adjusting for strong age effect, seasonal fluctuations remained significant with biannual peaks, 6 months apart. The most pronounced peak was observed during the first winter in the life of the newborn at an average age of about 4 months.\\n\\nBirth cohort studies offer an unbiased approach to examine the relationship between time of birth and susceptibility to infections and have substantial advantages in tracking unique features of specific diseases such as rotavirus where the incidence of symptomatic disease is heavily shifted towards the first few years of life and then diminishes rapidly. It also allows careful tracking of age effects and changes in immunity, and frequency and routes of exposure due to changes during child development including feeding patterns, introduction of weaning foods and changes in hygiene practices.\\n\\nA strong age effect was noticed in this study, with the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea decreasing steadily with increasing age. This is possibly due to the development of protective immunity to rotavirus, which prevented children from developing symptomatic infections at an older age. Natural rotavirus infection has been shown to confer protection against subsequent infection and disease [27,28]. Despite this strong age effect, the detection of seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of rotavirus infection is, on its own, remarkable.\\n\\nThe temporal clustering of the circulating rotavirus genotypes, even within a relatively short time series (Figure 4) was another important finding of this study, and is possibly a result of immune selection pressure. Also, the strain-specific variations in the seasonality of rotavirus observed in this study suggest that the seasonality of rotavirus may be strain-dependent. Therefore, in future studies, including data on the circulating rotavirus genotypes may provide a more robust estimate of the seasonality of rotavirus infection.\\n\\nIt has previously been observed that in temperate climates, the season of birth can adversely affect rotavirus diarrhea and children born in summer have a higher risk of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection that typically peaked in winter [29]. However, unlike in temperate climates, in this study two seasonal peaks of rotavirus diarrhea, 6-months apart, were observed which suggests that children in tropical climates may have the same risk of exposure to the virus, irrespective of their birth season. The staggered enrollment lasted for over one year (Figure 2), thereby enabling children born at different seasons to be equally represented in this study. Hence, it can reasonably be assumed that the effect of seasonality observed in this study was independent of their birth season.\\n\\nCohort studies with an intensive follow-up are difficult to replicate and such in-depth evaluation can be available only for a limited time period, small geographic area and relatively small sample size.

The observation of biannual peaks agrees with other studies of rotavirus in tropical climates [17,30,31,32,33]. Published data also provide an illustration of biannual peaks [17].\\n\\nIn a cross-sectional study in Dhaka, a total of 10,739 stool samples from patients admitted between January 2001 to May 2006 in the ICDDR,B hospital were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA-based methods, of which 2706 (25.2%) were found to be positive. A large proportion (>90%) of the rotavirus positive patients were children below the age of 2 years.\\n\\nApplying the harmonic regression model presented in this study, a predictive curve was produced that accounted for 80% of variability in the monthly time series of the proportion of rotavirus positive stool samples (see Figure 6). Although the shift to more severe cases due to differences in patient profiles has to be taken into account while comparing cohort data with community or hospital-based surveillance systems [24], this similarity of biannual peaks observed in the large surveillance sample and our relatively small cohort is encouraging.\\n\\n# Figure 6\\n\\nSeasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2001–2006) with pronounced biannual peaks.

The majority of studies on rotavirus diarrhea are hospital-based cross-sectional studies. From these studies, the prevalence of rotavirus among hospitalized children was found to be significant.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org | August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71616\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .author-contributions {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nTo range from 19.2–49.9% (average 33.6%). The proportion of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus was, however, much lower at 12% (range 7.1–15.5%) in outpatient settings. Converting our observed weekly incidence of 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks to an annual incidence would have resulted in an average (95% CI) of 0.22 (0.19–0.27) episodes of rotavirus diarrhea per child per year. This is comparable to the rotavirus diarrheal incidence of 0.16 (0.10–0.22) episodes per child-year among <2-year old children in an urban slum in Delhi.\\n\\nWhile birth cohort studies provide highly valuable information to close critical gaps in understanding disease burden, the design of such studies should be also explored as a working platform for investigating the emergence of novel pathogens and strains. In this study, a large number of untypable samples occurred before the switch to another type. Their disproportional increase might indicate the appearance of a new strain previously unknown and not seen for a period of time and not considered for typing. Using a wide range of information sources through triangulation and integration of epidemiological cohorts, surveillance systems, hospitalization records, and outpatient follow-up is a highly promising approach for a better understanding of the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases, tracking the emergence of pathogenic strains, and evaluating the efficacy of intervention programs.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- Dataset S1: Time series of selected variables presented in the study.

A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\\n\\nMany infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.\\n\\nPeriodic fluctuations can be successfully detected and modeled using statistical methods, which allows us to describe and compare seasonal characteristics: amplitude, peaks and troughs. An analysis of seasonality has to be performed on a sufficiently long time series to be able to capture many occurrences of seasonal increases. Thus, by abstracting records from large databases of medical records, including laboratory tests, hospitalizations and mortality records, long time series can be successfully compiled to provide the foundation for reliable assessment of disease seasonality. However, each data source might contain only a fraction of all events associated with infection and sometimes may offer biased reflection of a true incidence of infection in a community.\\n\\nWhile surveillance systems are an excellent source of data to study seasonality in a general population, they might not be ideal for tracking unique features of specific diseases. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore intricate details associated.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.ethics, .data-sources, .compilation, .adjustment, .assessment {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\nborder-left: 4px solid #007BFF;\\npadding-left: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nWith the emergence of seasonal patterns, longitudinal tracking of disease occurrence in each subject allows for the detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, complete genotyping, and comparison of observed strains in the same individual. This also links disease profiles to environmental, social, and genetic features.\\n\\nHowever, the specific features of cohort studies—such as staggered enrollment, age effects, and short follow-up periods—present substantial methodological challenges for seasonality analysis. Current analytical approaches for assessing seasonality are best suited for long time series with relatively stable populations and usually when the patterns of disease have a stable structure. It is useful to expand the methodology of seasonality analysis to this promising study design, which has already demonstrated advantages in understanding the natural history of viral and protozoan infections.\\n\\nRotavirus infection is a leading cause of morbidity in developing countries, and currently, there are a number of suitable vaccines. In temperate areas, the seasonality of rotavirus infection with a single winter peak is well documented. In tropical climates, its seasonality is less defined; however, sometimes an increase is noticed during cold and dry periods. Occasionally, two peaks within a single year are reported: one in winter and one in summer. The burden of rotavirus diarrhea is highest among very young children and decreases rapidly thereafter, which can introduce a strong age effect in the assessment of any temporal pattern.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Ethics Statement\\n\\nThis paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis from a birth cohort study in southern India, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of the participating children prior to enrollment, which also included permission to use the data for future research purposes. The time series presented in this study was assembled using de-identified data.\\n\\n# Data Sources\\n\\nWe used data from a birth cohort study on the natural history of rotavirus infection in Vellore, south India. In this study, a total of 452 children were recruited between March 2002 and August 2003 and followed up for a period of 3 years; a total of 373 (80%) children completed the follow-up period. Each child was subjected to a biweekly follow-up schedule to record diarrheal and other morbidities during the preceding days. Surveillance stool samples were collected every 2 weeks, and up to 3 diarrheal stool samples were collected every time the child had diarrhea. The stool samples were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA and PCR-based methods. The details of symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections over the 3-year period among the 373 children who completed the study have been reported elsewhere.\\n\\nData from all 452 children enrolled in this study was used to illustrate the seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in this cohort. We defined a diarrheal episode to be associated with rotavirus if one or more stool samples collected within 67 days of that episode was positive for rotavirus by PCR. Using this definition, we identified a total of 291 episodes of PCR-positive rotavirus diarrhea among the 452 children in this cohort. We also explored the effect of different rotavirus genotypes in the overall seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea among the study children.'"

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). These data include daily measurements of temperature, precipitation, and dew point. For some GEMS study sites, the closest weather station does not have complete data for the entire study interval (2007–2011). In these cases, we choose the closest weather station with nearly complete data; for example, the weather station for The Gambia site is in Tambacounda, Senegal which is approximately 77 kilometers away and is the largest distance between site and station used in this study.\\n\\nRelative humidity was computed using the following empirical relationship, originally defined by Bosen in 1958:\\n\\nRH = 100 × ((112 - (0.1 × T) + DP) / (112 + (0.9 × T)))^8\\n\\nwhere T is temperature in Celsius, DP is dewpoint in Celsius, and RH is relative humidity.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Child Enrollment by Fortnight in the Bangladesh Study Site\\n\\nFig 1.

Because different pathogens were associated with different seasons, the relative prevalence (and ranking) of pathogens among children with MSD differed by season. Among children 0 to 23 months old, rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently detected among eligible children in the winter, dry, or cool/dry seasons at all sites (22–57% of cases, Fig 6, left panel). In the rainy or monsoon months, rotavirus was less dominant, and Shigella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the most often detected. Among those 24 to 59 months old, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen at three of the seven sites in winter or cool/dry seasons (Fig 6, right panel). For these older children, V. cholerae is one of the top three pathogens at some sites during the monsoon or summer seasons.\\n\\n# Impact of Birth Month on Diarrheal Illness\\n\\nAnnual cycles indicate a birth month is a risk factor for diarrheal illness. If MSD or pathogen associated with MSD has a highly significant annual period, the age at which a child is most likely to get diarrhea depends on the birth month of a child. For example, if diarrheal disease peaks in the first quarter of the year, a child born in the second quarter might not be at high risk until six to nine months of age, while a child born before the first quarter may be at higher risk.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nFig 5.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites. Instead, our study indicates the necessity of local data to characterizing the epidemiology of diarrheal disease.\\n\\nCitation: Chao DL, Roose A, Roh M, Kotloff KL, Proctor JL (2019) The seasonality of diarrheal pathogens: A retrospective study of seven sites over three years.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year.

Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD).

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3].

      "Environmental factors play a significant role in the prevalence of diarrheal pathogens. Weather conditions, such as heat or rain, can drive the transmission of these pathogens. Flooding and contamination of drinking water are also mechanisms by which weather can favor pathogen survival and replication. Vectors that transmit disease between hosts, such as mosquitoes, may be more prevalent during certain seasons. The study found that some pathogens, including rotavirus, have regular annual peaks in prevalence. These seasonal patterns suggest that environmental factors contribute to the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help infer transmission pathways and predict large outbreaks. Weather can also influence the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites, further contributing to their prevalence. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering environmental factors in understanding the seasonality of diarrheal pathogens.

There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD).

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites. Instead, our study indicates the necessity of local data to characterizing the epidemiology of diarrheal disease.\\n\\nCitation: Chao DL, Roose A, Roh M, Kotloff KL, Proctor JL (2019) The seasonality of diarrheal pathogens: A retrospective study of seven sites over three years.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD).

For some GEMS study sites, the closest weather station does not have complete data for the entire study interval (2007–2011). In these cases, we choose the closest weather station with nearly complete data; for example, the weather station for The Gambia site is in Tambacounda, Senegal which is approximately 77 kilometers away and is the largest distance between site and station used in this study.\\n\\nRelative humidity was computed using the following empirical relationship, originally defined by Bosen in 1958:\\n\\nRH = 100 × ((112 - (0.1 × T) + DP) / (112 + (0.9 × T)))^8\\n\\nwhere T is temperature in Celsius, DP is dewpoint in Celsius, and RH is relative humidity.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Child Enrollment by Fortnight in the Bangladesh Study Site\\n\\nFig 1.

Because different pathogens were associated with different seasons, the relative prevalence (and ranking) of pathogens among children with MSD differed by season. Among children 0 to 23 months old, rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently detected among eligible children in the winter, dry, or cool/dry seasons at all sites (22–57% of cases, Fig 6, left panel). In the rainy or monsoon months, rotavirus was less dominant, and Shigella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the most often detected. Among those 24 to 59 months old, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen at three of the seven sites in winter or cool/dry seasons (Fig 6, right panel).

If MSD or pathogen associated with MSD has a highly significant annual period, the age at which a child is most likely to get diarrhea depends on the birth month of a child. For example, if diarrheal disease peaks in the first quarter of the year, a child born in the second quarter might not be at high risk until six to nine months of age, while a child born before the first quarter may be at higher risk.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nFig 5.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD).

In these cases, we choose the closest weather station with nearly complete data; for example, the weather station for The Gambia site is in Tambacounda, Senegal which is approximately 77 kilometers away and is the largest distance between site and station used in this study.\\n\\nRelative humidity was computed using the following empirical relationship, originally defined by Bosen in 1958:\\n\\nRH = 100 × ((112 - (0.1 × T) + DP) / (112 + (0.9 × T)))^8\\n\\nwhere T is temperature in Celsius, DP is dewpoint in Celsius, and RH is relative humidity.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Child Enrollment by Fortnight in the Bangladesh Study Site\\n\\nFig 1.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). These data include daily measurements of temperature, precipitation, and dew point. For some GEMS study sites, the closest weather station does not have complete data for the entire study interval (2007–2011). In these cases, we choose the closest weather station with nearly complete data; for example, the weather station for The Gambia site is in Tambacounda, Senegal which is approximately 77 kilometers away and is the largest distance between site and station used in this study.\\n\\nRelative humidity was computed using the following empirical relationship, originally defined by Bosen in 1958:\\n\\nRH = 100 × ((112 - (0.1 × T) + DP) / (112 + (0.9 × T)))^8\\n\\nwhere T is temperature in Celsius, DP is dewpoint in Celsius, and RH is relative humidity.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Child Enrollment by Fortnight in the Bangladesh Study Site\\n\\nFig 1.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites. Instead, our study indicates the necessity of local data to characterizing the epidemiology of diarrheal disease.\\n\\nCitation: Chao DL, Roose A, Roh M, Kotloff KL, Proctor JL (2019) The seasonality of diarrheal pathogens: A retrospective study of seven sites over three years.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\\n\\nMany infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.\\n\\nPeriodic fluctuations can be successfully detected and modeled using statistical methods, which allows us to describe and compare seasonal characteristics: amplitude, peaks and troughs. An analysis of seasonality has to be performed on a sufficiently long time series to be able to capture many occurrences of seasonal increases. Thus, by abstracting records from large databases of medical records, including laboratory tests, hospitalizations and mortality records, long time series can be successfully compiled to provide the foundation for reliable assessment of disease seasonality. However, each data source might contain only a fraction of all events associated with infection and sometimes may offer biased reflection of a true incidence of infection in a community.\\n\\nWhile surveillance systems are an excellent source of data to study seasonality in a general population, they might not be ideal for tracking unique features of specific diseases. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore intricate details associated.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.ethics, .data-sources, .compilation, .adjustment, .assessment {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\nborder-left: 4px solid #007BFF;\\npadding-left: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nWith the emergence of seasonal patterns, longitudinal tracking of disease occurrence in each subject allows for the detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, complete genotyping, and comparison of observed strains in the same individual. This also links disease profiles to environmental, social, and genetic features.\\n\\nHowever, the specific features of cohort studies—such as staggered enrollment, age effects, and short follow-up periods—present substantial methodological challenges for seasonality analysis. Current analytical approaches for assessing seasonality are best suited for long time series with relatively stable populations and usually when the patterns of disease have a stable structure. It is useful to expand the methodology of seasonality analysis to this promising study design, which has already demonstrated advantages in understanding the natural history of viral and protozoan infections.\\n\\nRotavirus infection is a leading cause of morbidity in developing countries, and currently, there are a number of suitable vaccines. In temperate areas, the seasonality of rotavirus infection with a single winter peak is well documented. In tropical climates, its seasonality is less defined; however, sometimes an increase is noticed during cold and dry periods. Occasionally, two peaks within a single year are reported: one in winter and one in summer. The burden of rotavirus diarrhea is highest among very young children and decreases rapidly thereafter, which can introduce a strong age effect in the assessment of any temporal pattern.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Ethics Statement\\n\\nThis paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis from a birth cohort study in southern India, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of the participating children prior to enrollment, which also included permission to use the data for future research purposes. The time series presented in this study was assembled using de-identified data.\\n\\n# Data Sources\\n\\nWe used data from a birth cohort study on the natural history of rotavirus infection in Vellore, south India. In this study, a total of 452 children were recruited between March 2002 and August 2003 and followed up for a period of 3 years; a total of 373 (80%) children completed the follow-up period. Each child was subjected to a biweekly follow-up schedule to record diarrheal and other morbidities during the preceding days. Surveillance stool samples were collected every 2 weeks, and up to 3 diarrheal stool samples were collected every time the child had diarrhea. The stool samples were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA and PCR-based methods. The details of symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections over the 3-year period among the 373 children who completed the study have been reported elsewhere.\\n\\nData from all 452 children enrolled in this study was used to illustrate the seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in this cohort. We defined a diarrheal episode to be associated with rotavirus if one or more stool samples collected within 67 days of that episode was positive for rotavirus by PCR. Using this definition, we identified a total of 291 episodes of PCR-positive rotavirus diarrhea among the 452 children in this cohort. We also explored the effect of different rotavirus genotypes in the overall seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea among the study children.'),\n",

Using this definition, we identified a total of 291 episodes of PCR-positive rotavirus diarrhea among the 452 children in this cohort. We also explored the effect of different rotavirus genotypes in the overall seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea among the study children.\\n\\nDaily data on ambient temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall for Vellore for the study period was obtained from the Regional Meteorological Office in Chennai, India. Average weekly temperature and humidity readings were then computed for the duration of the time series. The total volume of rainfall for a particular week was calculated using the daily rainfall measurements.\\n\\n# Compilation of Time Series\\n\\nAll samples tested for rotavirus contained the date of sample collection; thus, the created time series was 100% complete. Seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by aggregating the daily surveillance data into a weekly time-series of counts. Diarrheal episodes were assigned to the week corresponding to the first day of that episode. A week was defined as seven consecutive days from Sunday to Saturday, irrespective of any overlap between two calendar years. The first week of January 2002 was considered to be the first week of the time-series. Hence, for this study, the week-series commenced from March 10, 2002, and ended on the 243rd week, week ending August 31, 2006, for a total of 234 weeks.\\n\\n# Adjustment for Age and Cohort Effects\\n\\nIn cohort studies with staggered enrollment, there are at least three effects that might impact the time series: staggered enrollment, loss to follow-up, and age effect. To address these factors, two additional time series were created: a time series of weekly counts of the number of children (child-weeks of follow-up) in the study and a time series of the median age of children in a given week. Using the weekly counts of children and events (rotavirus diarrhea), incidence rates per 1000 child-weeks of follow-up were calculated. Therefore, the assessment of seasonality was based on the weekly incidence rates, adjusting for the aging in the cohort.\\n\\n# Assessment of Seasonality\\n\\nThe seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by fitting a Poisson harmonic regression (PHM) as a generalized linear model (GLM) considering two annual humps, which were accommodated by including four sine-cosine terms. To adjust for the cohort effect, we expanded the regression model by including child-weeks of follow-up as a linear term. The age effect of rotavirus diarrhea was explored by applying three different models: first using a linear term representing the median age of the cohort for the corresponding week, second by adding a quadratic term for the weekly median age to the linear term, and third by replacing the linear and quadratic terms by adding an exponential term representing the log-transformed median age of the cohort. Based on overall model performance and results interpretation, a linear term to represent the effect of age was selected. Finally, to consider the effects of meteorological variables, variables for weekly average temperature, humidity, and an interaction term were included to reflect the joint effect of temperature and humidity.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid black;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nThe sequentially-built final model can thus be depicted as below: incidence of 27.8 episodes per 1000 child-weeks. The predicted incidence from the model was 15.7 episodes per 1000 child-weeks.\\n\\nLog(E½Y) ~ b0 + b1 sin(2πvt) + b2 cos(2πvt) + b3 sin(4πvt) + b4 cos(4πvt) + b5 nt + b6 a + b7 T + b8 P + b9 TP + et, where t is time in weeks, v is frequency of 52.25, Yt is a time-series of incidence, nt is a term for weekly value of child-weeks of follow-up; at is a median age for a cohort at t-week, thus the regression parameter b6 reflects the change in the incidence associated with 1 week; T, P, and TP are values for weekly average temperature, humidity and their cross-product interaction, respectively; b are regression parameters, e is the error term. Using b6 we estimate the age effect as follows: d = 1 - exp{52.25b6}, where d is the percent reduction in the incidence over one year. In this model, parameters b1 through b4 refer to seasonal harmonics.\\n\\nBased on predicted curves, such seasonal increases were observed to repeat at least twice – one around week 72 and 84th week and then another around 96th and 108th week. During the peaks of these intervals (81st and 104th week respectively), the predicted rotavirus incidence was found to be 9.9 and 9.1 episodes per 1000 child-weeks respectively; and the median age of the cohort was 32.9 and 55.3 weeks respectively. A smaller hump was also observed at the inception of the study, peaking at the 25th week when the first 68 children were enrolled. The median age of the cohort at this time was 6 weeks, thereby indicating neonatal and early childhood infections.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe cumulative weekly distribution and the relative contribution of the different rotavirus genotypes are presented in Figure 4. Visualization of these data suggests clustering of rotavirus genotypes at certain time points. For example, rotavirus G1P [8] was the predominant circulating genotype between the 52nd and 67th weeks, whereas between the 103rd and 116th week, G2P [4] was found to be more common. As observed in Figure 3, the second peak of rotavirus diarrhea seems to be driven primarily by the G1P [8] genotype, whereas the fourth peak was mostly driven by G2P [4]. Interestingly, the third peak observed in Figure 3 (81st week) seems to be driven at least partially by G1P [4] and the untypable or partially typable rotavirus genotypes.\\n\\nThe weekly counts of detected rotavirus diarrhea (total 291 episodes) are plotted in a form of a needle-plot and presented in Figure 1. The time series (see Dataset S1) started from week 10, which refers to the beginning of enrollment. The observed average (95% CI) weekly incidence of rotavirus diarrhea was 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks. As expected, the initial weeks of the study had low counts of rotavirus diarrhea due to continuing enrollment. The highest count of rotavirus diarrhea was observed on the 73rd week of the study, which coincides with the end of the enrollment period.\\n\\nThe enrollment scheme is presented in Figure 2, which reflects three segments with characteristic features. Between the 10th and 84th week a steady increase is observed in the child-weeks of follow-up depicting the ongoing enrollment process; between the 84th and 204th week, a practically flat line in the child-weeks of follow-up was observed that denoted the time period when most of the children were being followed-up; thereafter, between 204 and 243rd a rapid decline was observed because of children completing the study. The ageing of the cohort is depicted in Figure 2 as a dashed line.\\n\\nOver the course of the study, the effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence. In one year, a significant reduction of 62.9, 66.6, 60.9, 71.5 percent was observed in the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea and three major genotypes, G1P [8], G2P [4], and G1P [4], respectively (p < 0.0001, see Table 1). The age-specific decline explained 32.1% of the variation in the incidence of rotavirus overall, whereas the seasonality and meteorological factors explained 6.1% of the overall model variation.'),\n",

We adjusted for age and cohort effects, and assessed the seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhea overall and that of three most common genotypes using a Poisson harmonic regression model. After adjusting for strong age effect, seasonal fluctuations remained significant with biannual peaks, 6 months apart. The most pronounced peak was observed during the first winter in the life of the newborn at an average age of about 4 months.\\n\\nBirth cohort studies offer an unbiased approach to examine the relationship between time of birth and susceptibility to infections and have substantial advantages in tracking unique features of specific diseases such as rotavirus where the incidence of symptomatic disease is heavily shifted towards the first few years of life and then diminishes rapidly. It also allows careful tracking of age effects and changes in immunity, and frequency and routes of exposure due to changes during child development including feeding patterns, introduction of weaning foods and changes in hygiene practices.\\n\\nA strong age effect was noticed in this study, with the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea decreasing steadily with increasing age. This is possibly due to the development of protective immunity to rotavirus, which prevented children from developing symptomatic infections at an older age. Natural rotavirus infection has been shown to confer protection against subsequent infection and disease [27,28]. Despite this strong age effect, the detection of seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of rotavirus infection is, on its own, remarkable.\\n\\nThe temporal clustering of the circulating rotavirus genotypes, even within a relatively short time series (Figure 4) was another important finding of this study, and is possibly a result of immune selection pressure. Also, the strain-specific variations in the seasonality of rotavirus observed in this study suggest that the seasonality of rotavirus may be strain-dependent. Therefore, in future studies, including data on the circulating rotavirus genotypes may provide a more robust estimate of the seasonality of rotavirus infection.'),\n",

However, unlike in temperate climates, in this study two seasonal peaks of rotavirus diarrhea, 6-months apart, were observed which suggests that children in tropical climates may have the same risk of exposure to the virus, irrespective of their birth season. The staggered enrollment lasted for over one year (Figure 2), thereby enabling children born at different seasons to be equally represented in this study. Hence, it can reasonably be assumed that the effect of seasonality observed in this study was independent of their birth season.\\n\\nCohort studies with an intensive follow-up are difficult to replicate and such in-depth evaluation can be available only for a limited time period, small geographic area and relatively small sample size.

The observation of biannual peaks agrees with other studies of rotavirus in tropical climates [17,30,31,32,33]. Published data also provide an illustration of biannual peaks [17].\\n\\nIn a cross-sectional study in Dhaka, a total of 10,739 stool samples from patients admitted between January 2001 to May 2006 in the ICDDR,B hospital were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA-based methods, of which 2706 (25.2%) were found to be positive. A large proportion (>90%) of the rotavirus positive patients were children below the age of 2 years.\\n\\nApplying the harmonic regression model presented in this study, a predictive curve was produced that accounted for 80% of variability in the monthly time series of the proportion of rotavirus positive stool samples (see Figure 6). Although the shift to more severe cases due to differences in patient profiles has to be taken into account while comparing cohort data with community or hospital-based surveillance systems [24], this similarity of biannual peaks observed in the large surveillance sample and our relatively small cohort is encouraging.\\n\\n# Figure 6\\n\\nSeasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2001–2006) with pronounced biannual peaks.

The majority of studies on rotavirus diarrhea are hospital-based cross-sectional studies. From these studies, the prevalence of rotavirus among hospitalized children was found to be significant.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org | August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71616\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .author-contributions {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nTo range from 19.2–49.9% (average 33.6%). The proportion of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus was, however, much lower at 12% (range 7.1–15.5%) in outpatient settings. Converting our observed weekly incidence of 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks to an annual incidence would have resulted in an average (95% CI) of 0.22 (0.19–0.27) episodes of rotavirus diarrhea per child per year. This is comparable to the rotavirus diarrheal incidence of 0.16 (0.10–0.22) episodes per child-year among <2-year old children in an urban slum in Delhi.\\n\\nWhile birth cohort studies provide highly valuable information to close critical gaps in understanding disease burden, the design of such studies should be also explored as a working platform for investigating the emergence of novel pathogens and strains. In this study, a large number of untypable samples occurred before the switch to another type. Their disproportional increase might indicate the appearance of a new strain previously unknown and not seen for a period of time and not considered for typing. Using a wide range of information sources through triangulation and integration of epidemiological cohorts, surveillance systems, hospitalization records, and outpatient follow-up is a highly promising approach for a better understanding of the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases, tracking the emergence of pathogenic strains, and evaluating the efficacy of intervention programs.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- Dataset S1: Time series of selected variables presented in the study.

We studied the relationship between ambient temperature and weekly notified Campylobacter spp. infections.\\n\\nMethods: Data on 29,762 laboratory-confirmed cases of Campylobacter infection for the period, January 1999 to December 2010 were retrieved from the Ministry of Health registry. To estimate the association between the number of weekly cases of Campylobacter infection and the national average temperature at lags 0–3 weeks, firstly, we used GAM models, and secondly two-segment piecewise linear Poisson regressions. The effect of temperature was adjusted for seasonality, long-term trends, and holidays.\\n\\nResults: We found a J-shaped relationship between ambient temperature and notified Campylobacter spp. cases. For C. jejuni in all ages, the curve below the threshold was constant and the percent increase in cases for 1 °C above a threshold of 27 °C was 15.4% (95%CI: 6.7–24.1%). For ages 3–10 yr and ≥26 yr the curve was constant below the threshold and positive above it; the percent increase in cases for 1 °C was 17.7% (95%CI: 6.0–29.4%) and 23.7% (95%CI: 11.6–35.8%), respectively. For ages 0–2 yr the curve was linear with no threshold and the percent increase for 1 °C was 5.1% (95%CI: 2.1–8.1%). For ages 11–25 yr the curve was always constant. Results for C. coli were similar.\\n\\nConclusion: Our findings indicate that higher temperatures throughout the year affect Campylobacter spp. morbidity, especially in younger children. This should be taken into consideration in public education and health system preparedness for temperature increases as a result of climate change.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter species have emerged as leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis and foodborne infections in developed countries since 1970 (EFSA, 2017). The annual incidence rates vary between 13/100,000 population in the United States (US), 71/100,000 population in the European Union, and 150/100,000 population in New Zealand (EFSA, 2017; The Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd, 2017; Crim et al., 2015). In Israel, the annual incidence rates of notified Campylobacter infections increased from 31 to 91/100,000 population between 1999 and 2010 and mostly affect toddlers younger than 2 years old (Weinberger et al., 2013). The vast majority of human infections are caused by 2 serotypes: Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, which are responsible for 80–90% and 10–20% of infections, respectively (EFSA, 2017).\\n\\nSymptoms of gastroenteritis due to Campylobacter infection usually persist for 3–4 days but may last for more than 1 week. The usual presentations include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Late but rare complications include Guillain-Barré and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Chronic sequelae are more common and include reactive arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome (Allos et al., 2015; Keithlin et al., 2014). The incubation period in the majority of cases is fewer than 6 days, but may last up to 10 days (Horn and Lake, 2013).\\n\\nCorresponding author: A.

In Israel, the age-specific annual incidence rate during 1999–2010 forms an asymmetric U-shaped curve; with the highest rates in the first and second years of life (363 and 349/100,000, respectively), the lowest rate in the fifth decade of life (13/100,000), and a slight increase that occurs toward the eighth decade of life (26/100,000) (Weinberger et al., 2013).\\n\\nThe incidence of campylobacteriosis varies seasonally and geographically in temperate regions, and tends to be highest during the summer months in several countries (Nylen et al., 2002; Tam et al., 2006) including Israel (Bassal et al., 2016a). The temperature may directly affect the rate of replication of pathogens and their survival in the environment. In the absence of any control measures, increased ambient temperatures may therefore increase bacterial contamination at various points along the food chain. Ambient temperatures may also influence people's behavior which, in turn, may be translated into more risky patterns of food consumption. For example, higher temperatures may lead to increased consumption of raw foods such as fruits and salads, and higher temperatures may encourage riskier cooking practices such as barbecuing (Kovats et al., 2005; Lake et al., 2009).\\n\\nFinally, in colder countries, warmer temperatures may lead to increased outdoor recreational activity, which may make it more likely that people will be exposed to environmental sources of the relevant gastrointestinal pathogens (Lake et al., 2009).\\n\\nFig. 1.

The registry completeness of Campylobacter spp. cases is about 90%. Demographic data on 29,762 laboratory-confirmed cases of Campylobacter infection among the Jewish population during the period, 1st January, 1999 to 31st December 2010 were obtained from the Campylobacter Reference Center.\\n\\nDuring the study period, there were no changes in the reporting practices and no interventions to control the disease. The date of each Campylobacter case was the date on which the specimen was submitted for culture in the reporting Microbiology laboratory. The delay between the disease onset and the submission of stool culture for testing is estimated at a median of 5–7 days based on a recent study from Israel (Ziv et al., 2011). Therefore, the reporting date was a reasonable indicator of disease's onset date, with an approximate 1-week delay. In order to achieve maximal homogeneity of the study population, only the Jewish population was included; during the study years, this accounted for 78.8% (1999) to 75.1% (2010) of the total population in Israel.\\n\\n# 2.2. Meteorological Data\\n\\nThe national temperature and relative humidity series were constructed using daily data from the weather climate station in Ben Gurion Airport (in the center of the country) obtained from the Israeli meteorological office archive. The mean temperature and relative humidity for each week were calculated and the weekly changes in this station represent quite well the changes across the country.\\n\\n# 2.3. Statistical Methods\\n\\nWe modeled the effect of temperature on the weekly number of cases (dependent variable) in two steps, assuming Poisson distribution with over-dispersion. Models were controlled for the following variables: holidays (number of days per week 1–7; typically, the number of cases are low during holidays and high immediately afterward); week number (1–626, to control for long-term effect); seasonality (Fourier terms, up to the second harmonic, were included).\\n\\nFirst, to explore the shape of the relationship, we fitted and graphed a Poisson Generalized Additive Model (GAM) model with a penalized natural cubic spline of weekly temperature. The degree of smoothness of model terms was estimated as part of the fitting. Smooth terms were represented using penalized regression splines with smoothing parameters selected by Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Kovats et al., 2004).\\n\\nSecondly, in order to quantify the relationship, we fitted a two-segment piecewise linear regression model (Kovats et al., 2004) under which it was assumed that there are different linear effects of temperature until a threshold value is reached, and afterward. The temperature threshold was estimated by maximum likelihood from among thresholds across all integer values of the temperature measure (Muggeo, 2003). Likelihood-profile confidence intervals were calculated from these arrays of likelihood, scaled to allow for over-dispersion. If the threshold temperature was found to be a value lower than the P25 (the 25th percentile) or greater than the P75.\\n---\\n# Environmental Research - Campylobacter Infection Study\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 5px;\\n}\\n.table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.table th, .table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\n}\\n.table th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental Research\\n\\n# Campylobacter Infection and Temperature Relationship\\n\\n# A.

For sensitivity analysis, we fitted a 3-segment piecewise linear regression model, with two thresholds and three slopes. Exploratory analysis indicated that the delay between high temperature and increased number of cases was not more than 3 weeks. Therefore, the temperature measure used in our models was a mean value of lags 0–3 weeks; this provided the combined effect of temperature from the previous month on the disease. We also investigated the effect of individual lags of weekly temperature entered separately into the model.\\n\\n# Stratification\\n\\nWe stratified the analysis according to the Campylobacter spp. main serotype: C. jejuni and C. coli, and to four age groups: toddlers (0–2 years, 28% of cases), children (3–10 years, 25% of cases), teenagers and young adults (11–25 years, 22% of cases), and adults (≥ 26 years, 25% of cases). Primary analyses (results not shown) indicated that relative humidity and other meteorological variables had no effect on Campylobacter infections; hence these were not included in the model.

We found a significant positive temperature-disease relationship for the two prominent serotypes in Israel, C. jejuni and C. coli; controlling for season, public holidays, and long-time trends. Beyond a threshold temperature of 27 °C, a 1 °C rise was found to correspond to a 16.1% increase of reported C. jejuni infection cases and 18.8% C. coli cases.\\n\\nOur results of a positive relationship between ambient temperature and notified cases of Campylobacter infection are consistent with research carried out in other countries with different weather conditions using time-series designs. A 1 °C rise in temperature was found to correspond to a 4.5% or 2.2% increase in Newfoundland–Labrador, Canada, and Alberta, Canada respectively, with a threshold temperature of 0 °C or −10 °C (Fleury et al., 2006). In Brisbane, Australia, the increase was 0.9% (Bi et al., 2008). A 1 °C rise in temperature was found to correspond to a 5.3% increase in infection cases in England and Wales (Lake et al., 2009). Our results suggest a more pronounced temperature effect, which might be related to the local hot Mediterranean climate.\\n\\nThe J-shaped temperature-Campylobacter infection relationship showing a positive slope after a threshold temperature that was found in our study following GAM modeling is not unique to this infection. Similar patterns were found in recent temperature-health epidemiological studies on ambient temperature-Salmonella infection relationship (Kovats et al., 2004) and in studies on temperature-mortality relationship (Baccini et al., 2008) which showed that temperature is a contributing factor for an increased risk of infection. Notably, higher thresholds were found in warmer climates for the temperature-mortality J-shaped relationships (Baccini et al., 2011).\\n\\nThese results clearly indicate that weather may be one of the contributing factors for Campylobacter infection. Temperature may impact on the growth of food-borne pathogens, animal reservoirs, and host behaviors (Rose et al., 2001). It may affect the level of poultry contamination with Campylobacter spp., the eating habits, and the type of food prepared in households (Bi et al., 2008).\\n\\nWe followed recent temperature-health studies using refined weekly notified cases of Campylobacter infection for studying the temperature effect. Daily data are usually too scarce to run appropriate analyses, and monthly data might not be able to provide up-to-date information for food-borne disease, and could be less sensitive in detecting climate impacts. We investigated the smallest length of accumulated lags needed to clarify temperature effect and found it to be up to 3 weeks. Campylobacter infections are foodborne, the main source being poultry consumption, both worldwide and in Israel (Weinberger et al., 2013, 2016; Bassal et al., 2016b; Wagenaar et al., 2013). Notably, the incubation period for Campylobacter gastroenteritis is roughly 1 week but may be even longer (Allos et al., 2015) and the delay in culture submission is 5–7 days (Ziv et al., 2011). Then we have to allow some more time for the purchase and preparation of the food item before consumption. Although Campylobacter spp. contamination may occur at any time-point, from farm to fork, the 4-week (lags 0–3) lag may...\\n---\\n# Temperature and Campylobacter Infection Relationship\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Campylobacter Infection Relationship\\n\\nA.

A Swiss study found a positive direct correlation between Campylobacter spp. prevalence in broilers and Campylobacter infection in humans with a 2-week delay (Wei et al., 2015). Similarly, in Denmark, a positive temperature-Campylobacter infection association was shown with a 4-week lagged effect (Patrick et al., 2004). In contrast, an international study by Kovats et al. (2005) reported a lag of more than 2 months in the relationship between temperature and peak-time of Campylobacter infection. The lag time could vary in different areas depending on local weather conditions and food processing, and longer lags could indicate the complexity of these relationships.\\n---\\n# Temperature-Campylobacter Infection Relationship\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.conclusion, .acknowledgements, .conflict-of-interest, .funding, .ethical-considerations {\\nmargin-top: 30px;\\nborder-top: 1px solid #ccc;\\npadding-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature-Campylobacter Infection Relationship\\n\\nFig. 4. Temperature – Campylobacter infection relationship; the effect of temperature for each week-lag between disease onset and temperature exposure (% change) for temperature above a threshold (27 °C).\\n\\nThe significance of the conditions earlier in the food production process, e.g., animal husbandry and slaughtering or processing and distribution, rather than the importance of food storage and hygiene close to the point of consumption (Bi et al., 2008). Further studies including more local influencing factors, such as socio-economic status and public health services, would be important to fully understand the causes of the various effects of weather variables on Campylobacter infection.\\n\\nAn age-related approach to the ambient temperature-Campylobacter infection relationship was not previously applied to this infection, despite the well-characterized differences in incidence trends of this infection. Age-stratified analyses in our study found different patterns (threshold and slope) between the 4 age groups. For C. jejuni incidence, age group 0–2 years appeared to be the most sensitive to temperature effect with no obvious temperature threshold; age groups 3–10 years and ≥26 years appeared to be sensitive to high temperature effect; age group 11–25 years appeared to be non-sensitive to temperature.\\n\\nThe unique pattern in age group 0–2 years can be explained by a higher sensitivity to Campylobacter infection due to the toddlers’ immature immune system. In a country with a high level and persistent exposure to Campylobacter spp., older age groups may develop immunity to the infection, which can mitigate the rate of infection (Weinberger et al., 2013). Thus, they will develop clinical infection only when the level of Campylobacter spp. exposure load is above a certain threshold. Additional explanation may be a different source of infection for this young age group. Handling and consumption of contaminated chickens is considered the major route for Campylobacter infection (EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards BIOHAZ, 2011). While it is less likely that toddlers of younger than 2 years old handle or consume undercooked chicken, they may be susceptible to cross-contamination in the household or even horizontal transmission from a sick older person in the household where chickens are consumed (Bassal et al., 2016b). Exposure to pets may also play an important role in these age groups (Buettner et al., 2010).'),\n",

Not all cases in the community are represented in such a data set. But there is no reason to believe that the degree of underreporting varies over time; nor is there reason to believe that the reporting varies during the weeks of the year (e.g., more in hot weeks) and therefore our results seem to be valid. In addition, the national surveillance data do not include any clinical data and infection encountered outside the country via traveling could not be excluded but since the percent of illness due to traveling is low this might not bias our results. Delay between disease onset and submission of stool for culture is estimated in Israel at 5–7 days.\\n\\nWe used the weather station in the national airport in the center of Israel to represent the whole country temperature weekly changes during the study period. Since the majority of the Israeli population reside in the center of the country (characterized with a Mediterranean climate) this limitation probably has a minor influence on the results.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOur findings of a J-shaped temperature-disease relationship are in line with other studies, albeit with an increased threshold temperature. Higher temperatures across seasons, prior to or around the time of food purchasing, probably play a role in human infection.

Effective interventions should target this age group.\\n\\nTemperatures are rising due to global climate change, and more weeks with the above-threshold temperature are expected to occur (Zittis et al., 2015). Without effective interventions, it is likely that the temperature effect on Campylobacter infection incidence may be even higher. Campylobacter foodborne illnesses should be considered in the adaptation and preparedness plans for temperature increase as a result of climate change, with a special focus on the very young age groups.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nThis research was supported by the Chief Scientist, Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection [grant Number 9-2-4].\\n\\n# Conflict of Interest\\n\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nThis research was supported by the Chief Scientist, Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection (grant Number 9-2-4).

Forecasting the risk of infection regionally may provide clues to identify sources of transmission affected by temperature and precipitation. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess temporal patterns and differences in campylobacteriosis risk among nine climatic divisions of Georgia, USA, (2) compare univariate forecasting models that analyze campylobacteriosis risk over time with those that incorporate temperature and/or precipitation, and (3) investigate alternatives to supposedly random walk series and non-random occurrences that could be outliers. Temporal patterns of campylobacteriosis risk in Georgia were visually and statistically assessed. Univariate and multivariable forecasting models were used to predict the risk of campylobacteriosis and the coefficient of determination (R2) was used for evaluating training (1999–2007) and holdout (2008) samples. Statistical control charting and rolling holdout periods were investigated to better understand the effect of outliers and improve forecasts. State and division level campylobacteriosis risk exhibited seasonal patterns with peaks occurring between June and August, and there were significant associations between campylobacteriosis risk, precipitation, and temperature. State and combined division forecasts were better than divisions alone, and models that included climate variables were comparable to univariate models. While rolling holdout techniques did not improve predictive ability, control charting identified high-risk time periods that require further investigation. These findings are important in (1) determining how climatic factors affect environmental sources and reservoirs of Campylobacter spp. and (2) identifying regional spikes in the risk of human Campylobacter infection and their underlying causes.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nTime series, Forecasting, Climatic factors, Campylobacteriosis risk, Control charting\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter has been identified as a leading cause of human gastroenteritis in developed nations (Allos and Taylor 1998; Altekruse and Swerdlow 2002) with an estimated 1% of the US population infected annually (Tauxe 2001). The bacteria are found throughout the natural environment, as well as in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals and birds (Snelling et al. 2005; Humphrey et al. 2007). Due to geographic diversity in land use, drinking and recreational water sources, and human behavior, establishing associations between campylobacteriosis risk and definitive environmental sources is difficult (Jepsen et al. 2009; Hartnack et al. 2009; Hearnden et al. 2003; Kovats et al. 2005; Miller et al. 2004; Bi et al. 2008).\\n\\nThe incidence of campylobacteriosis varies seasonally and geographically in temperate regions, and tends to be highest during summer months (Allos and Taylor 1998; Nylen et al. 2002; Tam et al. 2006). Variation in disease risk may be due to the effects of temperature and rainfall on the survival and reproduction of Campylobacter in the environment or on food sources (Patrick et al. 2004; Fleury et al. 2006; Bi et al. 2009). Disease forecasting may provide clues as to how direct and indirect sources of transmission are affected by climate variation in different geographic regions (Bi et al. 2008).

Research has shown that the seasonal patterns in campylobacteriosis risk vary among geographically diverse regions, yet are consistent within regions over time (Weisent et al. 2010; Kovats et al. 2005; Lal et al. 2012). Investigators have modeled the effect of climate on campylobacteriosis in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (Bi et al. 2008; Kovats et al. 2005; Fleury et al. 2006; Hearnden et al. 2003; Allard et al. 2010). However, divisional models that incorporate temperature and precipitation have not been investigated in the United States.\\n\\nInfectious disease patterns may change or behave erratically in response to biological and anthropogenic factors. Such changes can result in outliers—non-random deviations from the typical time series pattern. Outlier data points can take the form of a pulse, step or ramp, decay, or signify a more complicated directional change in the series. In surveillance data, change points may indicate outbreaks, geographic variation in reporting, and policy or prevention procedural changes. Outliers can greatly affect forecasting accuracy, and are particularly problematic for prediction when they occur near the end of a series or in the holdout (Bergmeir and Benitez 2012). Control charting can be used to detect outliers that can then be incorporated into models to understand and improve process performance as well as improve specification in forecasting and epidemic alert systems (Alwan 1988; Benneyan 2001). In this case study, some suggestions are made to provide practical ways of dealing with outlier issues in surveillance data.\\n\\nThe objectives of the research were to (1) assess temporal patterns and variations in campylobacteriosis risk in Georgia’s nine climatic divisions, (2) compare univariate time series forecasting models with those that incorporate exogenous climate variables (precipitation and temperature), and (3) investigate alternatives to supposedly random walk series and non-random occurrences that could be outliers. We hypothesize that regional variations in temperature and precipitation affect campylobacteriosis risk over time. Study findings provide early indications of irregularities in disease incidence and therefore guide disease control programs that are based on empirical forecast results (Nobre et al. 2001; Williamson and Weatherby Hudson 1999; Myers et al. 2000; Benschop et al. 2008).\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Study Area\\n\\nThe study was conducted in the state of Georgia which covers almost 87,000 km2 and is characterized by a humid subtropical climate that varies greatly with topography (sea level to 1,433 m in elevation). Approximately 114 cm of rain fall in the central regions and 180 cm fall annually in the northeast mountains (Netstate 2012). Summers are hot and humid with an average daily temperature close to 32 °C and winters tend to be mild, but are cooler in the mountains and piedmont than in the coastal and southernmost regions of the state.\\n\\nSince the late 1950s the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) has been recording and assessing temperature, precipitation, and other climate indices based on geographic divisions across the United States (NCDC 2012). Georgia contains nine adjacent divisions (Fig. 1a, courtesy of the NCDC Climate Prediction Center). Division 3 had the lowest population (219,400) and division 2, which includes Atlanta, the largest metropolitan area in the state, had the highest (3,875,000). The average population for the state of Georgia during the study years was approximately 8,828,600.\\n\\n# Data Sources and Preparation\"),\n",

The average population for the state of Georgia during the study years was approximately 8,828,600.\\n\\n# Data Sources and Preparation\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis case data for the state of Georgia were obtained from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), a program implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia (CDC 2010). A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed stool or blood sample that tested positive for Campylobacter. Names of patients were deleted prior to release of data to investigators and cases identified as travel-related were removed from the dataset to ensure consistent divisional risk estimates. The study was approved by The University of Tennessee Institutional Review Board.\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis case data were aggregated using SAS version 9.2 into counts, by month per county, over the 10-year study period (1999–2008), resulting in 120 equally spaced data points (SAS Institute 2008). Campylobacter case counts were then aggregated at the division level (159 counties share exact boundaries with nine divisions), and merged with annual NCDC division level climate data.\\n\\nThe measure of disease frequency used as the time series variable in the univariate analyses was monthly campylobacteriosis risk. Risk was defined as the probability that an individual will develop campylobacteriosis during the study period (Dahoo et al. 2003). Divisional risks were created in SAS by combining county level US Census Bureau annual population estimates as denominator data (U.S. Census 2010). The risk estimates were presented as the number of cases per 100,000 people, and a very small number (0.01) was uniformly added to the risk to account for a few zero values in the series.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nNobre et al. 2001; De Greeff et al. 2009; Altizer et al. 2006; Hartnack et al. 2009; Weisent et al. 2010; Kovats et al. 2005; Lal et al. 2012; Bi et al. 2008; Fleury et al. 2006; Hearnden et al. 2003; Allard et al. 2010; Bergmeir and Benitez 2012; Alwan 1988; Benneyan 2001; Williamson and Weatherby Hudson 1999; Myers et al. 2000; Benschop et al. 2008; Netstate 2012; NCDC 2012; CDC 2010; SAS Institute 2008; U.S. Census 2010.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk Analysis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n.highlight {\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\nborder-left: 4px solid #3498db;\\npadding: 10px;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Analysis of Campylobacteriosis Risk in Georgia\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis research paper presents an analysis of campylobacteriosis risk in Georgia, utilizing various statistical methods to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and potential outliers in the data.\\n\\nFig. 1: A Georgia state map including county names and climate division boundaries.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nThe divisional time series were plotted to visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and potential outliers.

For divisions with known outliers in or near the holdout, or those with poor holdout performance, a moving holdout period that spanned the last 24 months of data (2007–2008) was constructed. Coefficient of determination (R2) values were calculated and averaged for five holdouts with 12-month horizons (holdout months 1–12, 4–15, 7–18, 10–21, and 13–24). The training period was evaluated up to the beginning of each of the five holdout periods and the average compared with the holdout results from 2008.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Temporal Patterns of Campylobacteriosis Risk\\n\\nThe time series for Georgia campylobacteriosis risk is scaled and displayed with temperature and precipitation and shows a slight downward trend (P&lt;0.01; Fig. 3). Monthly risks ranged from 0.236 to 1.191 per 100,000 (mean=0.593; Table 1). Division risks were scaled for display with precipitation (Fig. 4a–i), and ranged from 0 (in all divisions except division 2) to 4.97 per 100,000 (division 3; Table 1). Divisions 3 and 5–9 showed no significant trend whereas divisions 2 and 4 had slight downward trends (P&lt;0.01) and division 1 trended slightly upward (P&lt;0.05). Autocorrelation function plots (not shown) indicated a strong seasonal pattern with potential autoregressive and moving average components. The patterns were not clean, implying that there could be outliers, unidentified patterns in the series, or both. Kruskal–Wallis results verified seasonality in all series except division 3, where the median risk between months did not vary significantly (P&gt;0.05).\\n\\nFig. 3 Risk (and linear trend) of campylobacteriosis (scale factor of 100), precipitation (scale factor of 10), and temperature in Georgia, USA from 1999 to 2008.\\n\\nA consistent seasonal peak between June and August (highest risk in July for most series) was identified in all divisions, including the aggregate state of Georgia. In some divisions, for some years, the peak began early. For example, in the year 2000, risks were higher in May than any other year. The seasonal peak extended into September, sporadically, across divisions and years. Division 3 seasonality did not vary significantly by month, yet the June through August peak is visually evident, although less pronounced, than the other divisions.\\n\\nTo illustrate an example of the unique relationship between campylobacteriosis risk and precipitation, we compared divisions 1 and 9 (Fig. 4a and i) from January 2005 to 2008. We chose these two divisions simply because they represent diverse climatic and geographic regions within the state (Fig. 1a and b). In 2005 when precipitation levels were “normal” (drought categories, in quotes, as determined by U.S. Drought Monitor indices (U.S. Drought Monitor 2012)), risk and precipitation mirror one another in shape and magnitude. In April 2006, Georgia entered a period of “abnormally dry” weather that increased to “moderate drought” by mid-June. By the end of August drought conditions were severe in a majority of the state, and stayed dry, with ranging severity, until the end of 2008. The time series patterns of 2005 may be reflective of normal rainfall. This was followed by risk and precipitation patterns that were muted and divergent, but still cohesive, during the beginning of the drought in 2006. A distinct increase in risk is evident in 2007 that continues throughout 2008 following 2 years of persistent drought conditions. This general pattern is also identified in divisions 2, 7, and 8 (Fig. 4b, g, and h) and at the state level (Fig. 3). During this time period the statewide impact of extreme weather conditions appears to override regional differences in geography and climate. There is no simple visual or statistical way to confirm the exact nature of the relationship between precipitation and risk.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk in Georgia\\n\\n# Table 1: Descriptive Statistics and Cross-Correlations\\n\\nDescriptive statistics and cross-correlations (temperature and precipitation) for monthly campylobacteriosis risk estimates per 100,000 population in Georgia, climate divisions 1–9, and combined divisions 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9.'),\n",

Cross-correlations for precipitation were weak and highly variable with the highest positive correlation for Georgia at time zero (0.31) and the highest negative correlation in division 9 (−0.35, lag 6). The strong seasonality of campylobacteriosis risk contributed to the strength and timing of the cross-correlations with temperature, and the weak correlations between risk and precipitation may be due to erratic divisional patterns.\\n\\nOutliers were not identified in the Georgia state level time series. Between one and two outliers were flagged in each division and combination series using Kruskal–Wallis monthly median analysis and/or control charts. All of the divisional series except division 2 contained zero values, notably division 3 (19/120, 15.8 %), division 6 (25/120, 20.8 %), and division 7 (18/120, 15 %; Table 1), yet these low-end values were not statistically significant outliers.\\n\\n# Forecasting Results and Comparisons\\n\\nTime series regression models were significant (P&lt;0.05) globally and for individual model coefficients. The best prediction results were obtained from the aggregated datasets (state of Georgia, then the combinations) followed by divisions 2 and 6 (Table 2). Decomposition and time series regression forecasting results and holdouts were comparable (within R² =10 %; Table 2), suggesting that one can forecast campylobacteriosis using a classical univariate modeling approach (time series risk data only), or by incorporating external climate variables. In divisions 3, 4, 7, and combinations 1–3 and 4–6, models with external variables, inclusive of outliers showed marginal improvement over decomposition.\\n\\nTemperature was significant (P&lt;0.05) in univariate regression models with impact ranging from R² =10 % in division 6, to 51 % for the state of Georgia (Table 2). Precipitation had a significant positive relationship with campylobacteriosis risk state wide, in the three combinations, and in divisions 2, 3, 6, and 9. The R² contribution of precipitation was less than 10 % when modeled alone and improved model significance when included in multivariable models for Georgia, combinations 1–3, and divisions 2, 3, 6, and 9. The 3-month moving average for precipitation that tested the cumulative effect of rainfall on campylobacteriosis risk decreased the predictive performance (R²) of the divisional models by 3–10 %, but improved.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Risk of Campylobacteriosis and Precipitation in Georgia\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 5px;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Risk of Campylobacteriosis and Precipitation in Georgia, USA\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study examines the relationship between precipitation and the risk of campylobacteriosis across various climate divisions in Georgia from 1999 to 2008.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nUnderstanding the impact of environmental factors on public health is crucial.

Our study confirmed a distinct seasonal peak in campylobacteriosis risk between June and August and unique seasonal variation among the nine divisions that was consistent for each over time.\\n\\nDivision level variation in risk may result from differences in sources of infection and urban versus rural residential status of individuals (Hearnden et al. 2003; Miller et al. 2004). Weather conditions, temperature, and precipitation may also impact contamination and carriage rates in environmental (animal and water) reservoirs differently from one division to the next. In some studies, environmental sources are responsible for the nearly simultaneous increase in Campylobacter infection rates in poultry and human populations (Meldrum et al. 2005; Patrick et al. 2004).\\n\\n# Figure 4: Precipitation Risk Division\\n\\nFig. 4 (continued)\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacteriosis Risk in Georgia\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\ncaption {\\nfont-weight: bold;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk in Georgia\\n\\n# Table 2: Decomposition and Time Series Regression with External Variables and Interventions for Georgia, USA'),\n",

In a Georgia ecological study, the highest Campylobacter counts were found in natural waters during the summer (Vereen et al. 2007) coinciding with the highest disease risk found in our study. Isolation from water is indicative of recent contamination, as replication does not occur outside the mammalian host (Eyles et al. 2003). However, it is unclear whether animals and the environment are being seasonally contaminated, re-infected, or subject to natural, biological, or management-related fluctuations in Campylobacter over time. To understand transmission routes and disease reservoirs for campylobacteriosis in Georgia, it may be necessary to hone in on the environmental, seasonal, and human population characteristics of specific divisions or distinct geographic locations.\\n\\nMultivariable time series regression models that included climatic factors improved model specification over univariate models—they attained white noise in the residuals. We expected climatic factors to be important. Previous studies have shown these variables to influence disease risk, as well as affect the survival and reproduction of Campylobacter spp. in the environment and on food sources (Patrick et al. 2004; Fleury et al. 2006; Tam et al. 2006; Bi et al. 2008). For example, seasonal increases in sunlight hours and warmer temperatures have a direct effect on human activities that increase exposure to Campylobacter sources (Hearnden et al. 2003). Known risk factors such as consumption of untreated water, contact with farm animals (Tam et al. 2006; Meldrum et al. 2005), swimming, camping, barbecuing, and other outdoor recreation (Obiri-Danso and Jones 1999; Schönberg-Norio et al. 2004) have been linked with increased seasonal risk and may also be due to changes in environmental sources of contamination (Hearnden et al. 2003). To fully determine how temperature, precipitation, and overall seasonality impact campylobacteriosis risk, it may be necessary to define and investigate an area of study based on the inherent risk factors for disease.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk and Temperature'),\n",

These results are consistent with previous research linking warmer temperatures with increased campylobacteriosis risk (Kovats et al. 2005; Fleury et al. 2006; Allard et al. 2010).\\n\\nTam and colleagues found that a 1 °C rise in temperature corresponded with a 5% increase in reported cases, up to 14 °C in England (Tam et al. 2006). In Sweden, mean annual temperature was associated with a slightly increased risk of campylobacteriosis (RR 1.05 [95% CI, 1.03–1.07]) (Nygard et al. 2004).\\n\\nIn Denmark, high temperatures 4 weeks prior to infection were good predictors (R² = 68%) of human incidence (P=0.05) (Kovats et al. 2005). Our models quantified the importance of temperature for the state of Georgia, demonstrating variation between divisions.\\n\\nCorrelations observed between temperature and disease risk may be associated with the presence of migratory birds, insects, and flies that play an important temperature-dependent role in disease transmission (Guerin et al. 2008; Ekdahl et al. 2005).\\n\\nTemperature has a strong influence on carriage and contamination rates in campylobacteriosis. In our study, seasonality was a likely contributor to the significant correlations in temperature found at lag 0, 6, and 12, as well as the diminishing, yet still significant correlation at lag one.\\n\\nIn the multivariable models, temperature at time zero, or at the 6-month lag, outperformed the 1-month lag, suggesting a complex relationship between temperature and disease risk.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nFurther investigation is warranted to determine if the division-level seasonal patterns identified in our study provide useful insights into transmission routes, as well as pathogen and host-specific interactions (Lal et al. 2012).\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Risk Factors\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThe complex interactions between sunlight, temperature, and humidity combine during certain times to enhance division level differences in the effect of temperature on risk (Patrick et al. 2004). We suspect that the importance of timing and temperature on campylobacteriosis risk may be dependent on the presence of unique regional or local disease reservoirs, be they natural (i.e., water, wild animals) or anthropogenic (i.e., agriculture, land use, runoff). Local public health officials must become knowledgeable about respective regional environments in order to identify and investigate important variations in risk factors for campylobacteriosis.\\n\\n# Precipitation\\n\\nPrecipitation patterns for the divisions correspond visually with campylobacteriosis risk during isolated sets of months, despite wide, erratic variations over the 10-year study period (Fig. 4a–i). This suggests that precipitation may be an important baseline factor and that divergent patterns are due to unknown local factors and spikes in campylobacteriosis risk. The predictive ability of precipitation (<10 % R2) was similar to that of a Denmark study in 2004 where precipitation explained 6 % of the variation in human incidence (Patrick et al. 2004).\\n\\nAs indicated by our case study of years 2005–2009 (divisions 1 and 9), climatic factors may combine to invoke a “threshold” at which the cumulative impact of summer induces an exponential biological or behavioral increase in the risk of campylobacteriosis, or causes outbreaks that are undetected by current surveillance. In regions where summer is characterized by increased rainfall and flooding, pathogen levels are magnified as fecal material is transferred from land to surface waters (Eyles et al. 2003; Coker et al. 2001).\\n\\nOur data showed an increase in risk during drought. While rainfall may improve survival and leaching of the bacteria, drought conditions concentrate bacterial loads (Patrick et al. 2004; Sinton et al. 2007). Northeast Georgia is well known for livestock production, specifically intensive poultry farms. Local investigation of the environmental impact of the animal production industry and its effects on human populations at risk may lead to a better understanding of the relationship between precipitation and campylobacteriosis in this area.\\n\\nResults of the 3-month moving average for precipitation (improved predictions for the state of Georgia and worsened divisional predictions) suggest that the predictive sense may be unique to each division. For example, smoothing techniques diluted the association between campylobacteriosis risk and precipitation at the division level. Significant division level relationships between precipitation and campylobacteriosis risk in our study may explain why studies that use data over large geographic areas observe no such association (Kovats et al. 2005).\\n\\nAnalogous to a magnifying lens, whereby “zooming out” (smoothing or aggregating data) conveys a broader sense of the relationship, “zooming in” captures the detail, as well as the anomalies. Public health officials should objectively and qualitatively assess time periods where campylobacteriosis risk diverges from typical precipitation patterns and investigate the potential causes. In doing so, decisions for control and prevention are based on empirical evidence.\\n\\n# Statistical Control Charts and Outliers\\n\\nIn our study, control charts served to focus attention on specific time periods of high campylobacteriosis risk. While it may be useful to identify erratic points in an aggregated dataset, the division level control charts narrow the focus of investigation. For example, May 2000 and June 2003 were flagged in the combination 4–6 series, and further identified in divisions 5 and 6, respectively. Traditional models often incorporate smoothing, robust methods or model outliers to meet assumptions, thereby sculpting a state of statistical control.\\n\\nAccording to Alwan and Roberts, improving our ability to distinguish between special causes and common causes (in this case, for example, outbreaks vs. known seasonality) justifies the effort to identify an “out of control process” (Alwan 1988). Alternatively, statistical control charting can be used as a guideline to assess expected vs. observed level of risk (Benneyan 2001) and serve to augment predictive models when patterns are erratic.\\n\\nIn the poorest performing divisions with outliers (divisions 1 and 4) and without outliers (division 9) we were unable to identify the point of tension in the series whereby the analysis could be improved or refined with a moving holdout. Excessive variation, randomness or outliers in the 24-month holdout period, holdout or horizon lengths, or a combination of these may have contributed to the lack of improvement.\\n\\nWhile outliers near the end of a series or in a holdout can have severe effects on forecasting ability and accuracy (Bergmeir and Benitez 2012), incorporating moving holdouts may be impractical in the realm of public health when model improvement is not a guarantee, and the process requires expertise and can be time consuming. We recommend that these methods be reserved for time series with forecasts that are significantly improved (>10 % R2) as a result of accounting for such outliers.\\n\\n# Limitations'),\n",

The presence of outliers or change points can alter patterns and invalidate forecasts and the effect of zero values in these series is unclear.

In these situations, a decision must be made as to what objectives are most important—accurate predictions or understanding biological and epidemiological patterns.\\n\\nThe divisional datasets illustrate potential real-life dilemmas such as small number problems, unidentified outbreaks, variations, and inconsistencies inherent in surveillance data. Campylobacter infection is typically self-limiting and people who become ill do not always seek care. In general, surveillance systems tend to underestimate actual disease risk and reporting may vary between states and divisions; therefore, predictions should be interpreted with caution. However, these data were actively ascertained and thought to represent the burden of culture-confirmed campylobacteriosis (Scallan et al. 2011).\\n\\nThe models and divisions varied in the ability to achieve normality and/or white noise in the residuals. Lack of white noise may increase model uncertainty or indicate misspecification, as patterns in the residuals are not accounted for. However, models without perfect attainment of white noise can have valid results (Burkom et al. 2007), and poor predictive performance was likely due to outliers as opposed to issues of model specification.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nDivision level climatic factors and statistical control charting improve models for predicting monthly campylobacteriosis risk, particularly when there are erratic, non-random patterns in the time series. Control charts can serve as an early warning system by detecting irregularities in campylobacteriosis risk at the division level. Forecasting on aggregated data (the state of Georgia, or combinations of divisions) improved our explanation of the variance in risk in decomposition models and multivariable time series regression. However, division level patterns and their associations with temperature and precipitation highlight how important information can be gleaned from finer levels of analysis. Public health officials can more readily address unusual high risk estimates in a timely manner by focusing investigations on the causal factors that relate directly to the region of interest. Climate information can be rapidly and freely obtained; therefore, assessing the baseline impact of temperature and precipitation may be a useful “real-time” alternative for those who do not have ready access to surveillance data. The descriptive information, temporally housed in empirical Campylobacter disease risk data may also improve our understanding of biological, environmental, and behavioral drivers of disease. Furthermore, modeling and comparing campylobacteriosis patterns among divisions with different environmental characteristics may lead to the identification of unique disease transmission routes, sources, and reservoirs.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network for providing data for this study.\\n\\n# Conflict of Interest\\n\\nNone.\\n\\n# Open Access\\n\\nThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAllard R, Plante C, Garnier C, Kosatsky T (2010) The reported incidence of campylobacteriosis modelled as a function of earlier temperatures and numbers of cases, Montreal, Canada, 1990–2006.

Two key findings from our model include: an estimated 4.6% increase in the risk of reported cryptosporidiosis associated with 22.8% higher percentage of postal area covered with original habitat; and an estimated 1.8% increase in disease risk associated with a 77.99 mm increase in annual rainfall anomaly at the postal area level.\\n\\nDiscussion: These results provide novel insights regarding the predictive effects of extreme rainfall and the proportion of remaining natural habitat, which add unique explanatory power to the model alongside the socioeconomic factors.\\n\\nCorresponding author: Aparna Lal, National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Building 62, Canberra City, Australian Capital Territory 2600, Australia.\\n\\nEmail: Aparna.lal@anu.edu.au\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148243\\n\\n© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\\n\\nChanges to land use and climate variability are two major drivers of emerging infectious disease spill over in humans. Over 60% of known infectious diseases in humans have originated in animals (Karesh et al., 2012). Human-wildlife interaction is increasing, in part due to population expansion into native habitats (Lischka et al., 2018). Previous research indicates that agriculture-related land use is associated with >25% of emerging infectious diseases and >50% of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases in humans (Guo et al., 2019). Poor communities are disproportionately affected by climate and environmental changes, amplifying their risk to these infections.\\n\\nAssociations between climatic conditions, changes in land use and infectious disease incidence may be observed at a range of spatial and temporal scales. In this study we develop a Bayesian spatiotemporal model for disease risk using reported cryptosporidiosis as a model disease, one with some known zoonotic reservoirs, that is easily spread through water and associated with changes in rainfall (Hu et al., 2010a), temperature (Hu et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2010b), history of flooding (Lal et al., 2019) and drought (Lal and Konings, 2018). Cryptosporidiosis is a challenge to control because Cryptosporidium oocysts are highly resistant to disinfectant chemicals used to treat recreational and drinking water and a low dose is required to induce infection (Fayer et al., 2000). In Australia, the rates of reported cryptosporidiosis in tropical and remote populations are nearly eight times higher than comparable urban populations (Lal et al., 2015a), indicating that routes of spread are likely to be affected by environmental changes (Lal et al., 2015b).\\n\\nIn addition to local context specific factors, individual risk factors for reported disease in Australia include young age (Lal et al., 2015a), contact with livestock (Ng et al., 2012; Ryan and Power, 2012; Waldron et al., 2011), exposure to contaminated recreational water (Dale et al., 2010; Loganthan et al., 2012) and socio-economic conditions (Lake et al., 2007; Becker et al., 2015), similar to many other infections. The majority of these studies have used time-series methods or have been restricted to a specific region. What remains unclear is the extent to which cryptosporidiosis disease risk is uniquely associated with climatic factors and changes to land use when accounting for the effects of known risk factors and spatiotemporal variation.\\n\\nLivestock production is a major industry in Australia, over 54% of Australian land is used for grazing 88 million sheep and cattle (ABARES, 2021; ABS, 2021). Zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium from livestock to humans has been reported in rural Australia (Ng et al., 2008; Ng et al., 2012). While there are higher concentrations of pathogens in domestic species (Cox et al., 2005), several molecular studies have also established the potential for zoonotic transmission between wildlife, such as kangaroos and rabbits, and humans (Zahedi et al., 2016a; Zahedi et al., 2016b). Recent work has shown that mammal species that harbour more pathogens are more likely to occur in human-managed ecosystems (Gibb et al., 2020). When humans encroach wildlife populated areas by changing land-use and altering native habitats, the potential for zoonotic transmission may increase (Gottdenker et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2013). A novel contribution of this study is the association of disease risk with postal area level estimates of percentage of native habitat, as a proxy for land use change and potential for mammalian reservoirs.\\n\\nThe main aim of this study was to evaluate the association between local changes in land use and rainfall extremes with reported cryptosporidiosis cases at the postal area level across Australia, while adjusting for well-known risk factors like age, population density and socioeconomic disadvantage, over 18 years. Analysis was implemented using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) (Rue et al., 2009) in the R package R-INLA ([Anonymous]), which offers a computationally efficient approach to Bayesian inference that has been successfully applied to disease incidence and prevalence mapping to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the data (Blangiardo et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2012; Khana et al., 2018; Schrödle et al., 2011).\\n\\n# 2.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) identified 2513 domestic postal areas, ranging in area from 1.8 × 10−1 to 1.2 × 106 km2, and ranging in population from 0 to 106,746 persons (ABS, 2016). Spatial bounds of postal areas as defined in 2011 were obtained in ESRI shapefile format from the ABS (ABS, 2011b).\\n\\n# 2.2. Covariate selection\\n\\nWe selected covariates on the basis of existing literature on factors related to cryptosporidiosis risk. These included: sociodemographic variables of population density (Pollock et al. 2010; Waldron et al., 2011), age structure (Lal et al., 2015b), and socioeconomic disadvantage (Becker et al., 2015); a rainfall anomaly variable measuring difference in average annual rainfall as a departure from the average annual rainfall over the entire time period (1990–2017) (Hu et al., 2010a; Hu et al., 2010b; Lal et al., 2019); and a habitat variable measuring percentage of land area covered by natural habitat in each postal area. All covariates were scaled and centred to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 before inclusion in the model. All covariates were transformed to be measured at the postal area level before inclusion in the model and all data were projected into the same Coordinate Reference System as the Shapefile obtained from the ABS.\\n\\n# 2.2.1. Data sources\\n\\n# 2.2.1.1. Disease data\\n\\nThis study used nation-wide data on reported cryptosporidiosis incidence across Australia, obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) database, measured at the postal area level from 2001 to 2018, excluding the Australian Capital Territory (Australian Government Department of Health (DoH), 2021). The NNDSS is managed by the Australian Government Department of Health (DoH) and is overseen by the Communicable Disease Network Australia (CDNA) (DoH, 2021). For notifications, cases were defined according to the national case definition for confirmed cases, requiring laboratory definitive evidence only with no clinical criteria (DoH, 2017).\\n\\n# 2.2.1.2. Social and demographic data\\n\\nData on demographics at the postal area level was obtained from National Census data provided by the ABS (ABS, 2001, 2006, 2011a, 2016). These included postal area population density, age composition, and Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSD). The IRSD is a general, area-level socio-economic index derived from the Australian National Census variables related to disadvantage, such as low income, low educational attainment, unemployment, and dwellings without motor vehicles.

Rainfall Anomaly\\n\\nMonthly historic precipitation grids at 0.05 resolution from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) were used to calculate the total precipitation for each year. We then calculated the mean annual precipitation for the period 1990–2017. The anomaly was calculated as the difference of each year to the mean and this was summarized for all the grid cells within each postcode.\\n\\n# 2.2.1.4. Native Habitat Data\\n\\nData on percentage of land area covered by original native habitat was derived from the biodiversity habitat condition data from Harwood et al. (2016). These data represent the relative condition of every 1 km grid cell across Australia in terms of its capacity to support the pre-European assemblage of species. These habitat condition data are calculated based on satellite data recorded between 2001 and 2012. For the present analyses, we summarised these gridded data by calculating the mean percentage of habitat capable of supporting a pre-European assemblage of species (hereafter referred to as “original habitat”) within each postal area.\\n\\n# 2.4. Model Selection\\n\\nModel selection was undertaken using the deviance information criterion (DIC), where a lower DIC indicates a better trade-off between model fit and parsimony (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). Of the options we tested for modelling spatial and temporal effects, the best fitting option included: spatially structured and unstructured random effects using a Besag-York-Mollie model; a temporally structured random effect using an autoregressive order 1 model; and a space-time interaction term. Full details on model selection for spatial and temporal effects can be found in the Supplementary Materials.\\n\\n# 3. Results\\n\\n# 3.1.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn a study conducted over the years 2001–2018, it was observed that individuals living in more advantaged urban areas were more likely to visit a general practitioner (GP) compared to those in less advantaged rural areas (86% versus 83%) (ABS 2017). This disparity in help-seeking behavior may influence the results of health-related studies.\\n\\n# Model Selection and Performance\\n\\nOur final model was selected based on predictive performance and usefulness. Although the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) was lower for models 1 and 2 than for Model 3, the difference of less than 3 is considered negligible (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). Model 3 was chosen as it provided meaningful insights into the impact of rainfall patterns and habitat conditions on the incidence of diagnosed cryptosporidiosis without compromising predictive performance.\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\nThis study is the first to include postal area level estimates of original habitat condition as an environmental predictor of reported cryptosporidiosis in Australia. A greater proportion of land in original habitat condition was associated with an increased risk of diagnosed cryptosporidiosis. A 2014 global review indicated that anthropogenic land use changes, such as deforestation and agricultural development, may increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission (Myers et al., 2013).\\n\\n# Future Research Directions\\n\\nFuture research should focus on the sources of Cryptosporidium spp. in hotspots where the risk of illness is high and the association with original habitat condition is significant. This will be crucial for developing land management actions and public health responses to mitigate this risk.\\n\\n# Livestock Density and Disease Risk\\n\\nLivestock density is a known environmental predictor of cryptosporidiosis (Lal et al., 2016). However, access to quality data on livestock distribution was limited. The Gridded Livestock of the World Database presented quality issues, and models incorporating livestock density as covariates performed poorly. The positive relationship between cryptosporidiosis and habitat condition may be linked to extensive livestock grazing in rangelands that support substantial biodiversity, potentially amplifying disease risk (Di Marco et al., 2020).\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nYears with higher rainfall compared to the baseline period were associated with an increased risk of diagnosed cryptosporidiosis, consistent with global patterns (Jagai et al., 2009). Understanding these relationships is vital for public health and environmental management.\\n\\nReferences: ABS (2017), Spiegelhalter et al. (2002), Myers et al. (2013), Lal et al.

Science of the Total Environment 791 (2021) 148243\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nHeavy rainfall can flush animal and human faeces into surface drinking water sources, contaminating them and increasing the risk of illness. Areas north of Sydney where the effect of heavy rainfall and original habitat condition are high may be good candidates for focused fieldwork to quantify the potential for zoonotic transmission and the role of short periods of localized heavy rainfall.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nWhile our study captures very wet and dry years at a postal area scale, it is plausible that spikes in reported cryptosporidiosis are driven by localized periods of high intensity rainfall following long dry periods. Future work in Australia investigating the influence of rainfall at a finer temporal resolution at a postal area level would help clarify how short-term rainfall patterns affect dynamics of infectious disease incidence.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nDespite the increasing focus on understanding environmental and climatic drivers of infectious diseases, work investigating the impact of land use changes and weather patterns has received surprisingly little attention in Australia. Our results demonstrate the importance of an integrated approach when dealing with disease risk that may be affected by future environmental change.\\n\\n# CRediT authorship contribution statement\\n\\nAparna Lal: Supervision, Conceptualization, Methodology, Software and initial code preparation and visualisation using maps and Writing-Reviewing and Editing.

This paper examined the impact of social economic and weather factors on cryptosporidiosis and explored the possibility of developing such a model using social economic and weather data in Queensland, Australia.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nData on weather variables, notified cryptosporidiosis cases and social economic factors in Queensland were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Queensland Department of Health, and Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Three-stage spatiotemporal classification and regression tree (CART) models were developed to examine the association between social economic and weather factors and monthly incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Queensland, Australia. The spatiotemporal CART model was used for predicting the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Queensland, Australia.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe results of the classification tree model (with incidence rates defined as binary presence/absence) showed that there was an 87% chance of an occurrence of cryptosporidiosis in a local government area (LGA) if the socio-economic index for the area (SEIFA) exceeded 1021, while the results of regression tree model (based on non-zero incidence rates) show when SEIFA was between 892 and 945, and temperature exceeded 32°C, the relative risk (RR) of cryptosporidiosis was 3.9 (mean morbidity: 390.6/100,000, standard deviation (SD): 310.5), compared to monthly average incidence of cryptosporidiosis. When SEIFA was less than 892 the RR of cryptosporidiosis was 4.3 (mean morbidity: 426.8/100,000, SD: 319.2). A prediction map for the cryptosporidiosis outbreak was made according to the outputs of spatiotemporal CART models.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nThe results of this study suggest that spatiotemporal CART models based on social economic and weather variables can be used for predicting the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Queensland, Australia.\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by microscopic parasites of the Cryptosporidium parvum [1]. The parasite is one of the most common causes of waterborne disease in Australia and globally and is found in drinking water and recreational water [2]. Cryptosporidiosis can also be transmitted via contaminated food, contact between people, or contact between people and animals. It is considered a drinking-water-borne disease because the largest outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been associated with contaminated drinking water. The individual risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in humans include drinking water from poorly treated public and private supplies, community swimming pools, day care centres and contact with farm animals. The seasonal occurrence of cryptosporidiosis has been cited as circumstantial evidence of a climatic link [3,4].\\n\\nSpatiotemporal analyses of disease have played a major role in environmental epidemiology. Logistic regression, polyclass and generalised linear models have been widely used to study relationships between diseases and various environmental risk factors. However, these statistical techniques also perform relatively poorly with high dimensional data.\\n\\n© 2010 Hu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

An alternative approach is to use spatiotemporal classification and regression tree (CART) models, which can better accommodate complex interactions.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Study Area\\n\\nQueensland, located in the northeast of Australia, is the second largest state with a typically sub-tropical climate. It covers approximately 1,727,000 km2 and consists of 125 statistical local government areas (LGA).\\n\\n# Data Collection\\n\\nData on notified cryptosporidiosis cases by LGA in Queensland for the year 2001 was obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Weather and socio-economic index for areas (SEIFA) data were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\\n\\n# Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis\\n\\nMoran’s I spatial autocorrelation statistic was calculated to determine whether spatial clustering was a feature of cryptosporidiosis disease. A value close to 0 indicates randomness, while a positive (negative) value indicates positive (negative) autocorrelation.\\n\\n# Spatial Empirical Bayes Rates Smoothing\\n\\nA Bayesian random effects model was used to compute the spatial empirical Bayes rates smoothing and estimate the underlying distributions of incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis disease for each LGA and for Queensland overall.\\n\\n&copy; 2023 Research on Cryptosporidiosis in Queensland\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nHu et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:311\\n\\nLink to the full paper\\n\\n# Spatial Analysis of Cryptosporidiosis Cases\\n\\nThe analysis of cryptosporidiosis cases was conducted within a spatial window defined by a spatial weights file that included each Local Government Area (LGA) and its neighbors. The observed cryptosporidiosis rate for an LGA with a small population at risk was adjusted considerably toward the average, while for a larger LGA, the rate showed minimal change.\\n\\nSpatial empirical Bayes analyses were performed using GeoDa. The locations of cryptosporidiosis cases by LGA were geo-coded to digital base maps using MapInfo, GeoDa, and Microsoft Access software.\\n\\n# Spatiotemporal CART Models\\n\\nGiven the high incidence of zero counts (approximately 85%) in the monthly cryptosporidiosis count data at the LGA level, special care was required to account for extra variation beyond the typical Poisson assumption. The data typically exhibited \"outbreaks\" characterized by very high incidences, which are challenging to model with a single parameter Poisson distribution.\\n\\nThe excess zeros can be categorized into two subgroups: LGAs that could not have cryptosporidiosis during the study period and LGAs that could have had cases but did not report them. We considered three spatiotemporal CART models:\\n\\n1. CART 1: Fitting a tree to data categorized as binary: incidence/no incidence.\\n2. CART 2: Fitting a tree to positive incidences.\\n3. CART 3: Fitting a tree to outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\n# CART 1: Binary Classification Tree\\n\\nA classification tree was developed to explore relationships between socio-economic and weather factors and monthly cryptosporidiosis incidence. The outcome variable was defined as whether one or more cryptosporidiosis cases occurred in the LGA in a given month. The model was described as:\\n\\nmonthly cryptosporidiosis presence/absence ~ SEIFA + maximum temperature + rainfall + factor (season)\\n\\nThe results were reported as the probability of occurrence of cryptosporidiosis in an LGA in a month.\\n\\n# CART 2: Regression Tree for Positive Incidences\\n\\nThis model used positive monthly cryptosporidiosis incidence rates as a continuous response variable. The model was described as:\\n\\nMonthly cryptosporidiosis rate ~ SEIFA + maximum temperature + rainfall + factor (season)\\n\\nThe results were reported as the relative risk (RR) of positive incidence compared to the average incidence rate.\\n\\n# CART 3: Outbreaks of Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nAn outbreak was defined if the incidence rate in any month exceeded the third quartile of the incidence rates per LGA in Queensland during the 12 months of 2001. The model was described as:\\n\\nmonthly cryptosporidiosis outbreak/non-outbreak ~ SEIFA + maximum temperature + rainfall + factor (season)\\n\\nThe results were reported as the probability of occurrence of an outbreak in a month.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nEach CART analysis consisted of three basic steps:'),\n",

BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:311\\n\\nPage 4 of 13\\n\\nLink to the full article\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Descriptive Analysis\\n\\nTable 1 shows the summary statistics for each variable. The monthly mean incidence rate of cryptosporidiosis, maximum temperature, rainfall and SEIFA were 15.11, 28.17°C, 59.64 mm and 934.17, respectively. Figure 1 depicts the variation over time in cryptosporidiosis between January 2001 and December 2001. The curves indicate a seasonal pattern. About 45% of cryptosporidiosis cases occurred in children under 4 years old in 2001.\\n\\n# Bivariate Analyses\\n\\nTable 2 shows the linear associations between the cryptosporidiosis incidence and temperature, rainfall and SEIFA. It also summarises the bivariate linear relationships between all the independent variables. For the database without zero incidences, SEIFA (r = -0.535, p = 0.000) and temperature (r = 0.349, p = 0.000) were significantly associated with cryptosporidiosis incidence. For the full database including zero incidences, rainfall (r = 0.152, p = 0.000) and SEIFA (r = 0.192, p = 0.000) were significantly linearly associated with cryptosporidiosis incidence. Rainfall was also statistically associated with temperature for the database without zero incidence (r = 0.346, p = 0.000) and for the full database (r = 0.378, p = 0.000). The pairwise scatter-plot with spline regression line depicts the relationships between all the variables by season in Figure 2. As suggested by this figure, the incidence rates were associated with the SEIFA and temperature for the database without zero incidences in summer and autumn. However, the incidence rates were not as associated with the SEIFA and temperature for the full database in any season (Figure 3).\\n\\nThere was a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of cryptosporidiosis incidence (including zero incidences) with a Moran’s I statistic of 0.213 (p = 0.015).\\n\\n# Spatial Distribution Empirical Bayes Rates Smoothing\\n\\nFigure 4 depicts the geographic distribution of the notified cryptosporidiosis incidences in Queensland during 2001. The figure confirms that the risk for cryptosporidiosis varied with geographical location. The Bayesian posterior estimates of the cryptosporidiosis rates for each LGA are depicted in Figure 5. The spatial empirical Bayes analysis showed that the cryptosporidiosis infection activity was primarily concentrated in the north, southeast and southwest of Queensland, Australia.\\n\\n# CART Models\\n\\n# CART 1 Model\\n\\nFigure 6 represents the final CART model for presence/absence of cryptosporidiosis. This figure indicates that presence of cryptosporidiosis was predominantly explained by SEIFA, with an 87% chance of an occurrence if the SEIFA was in excess of 1021 (2 LGA, 24 months). The validation analyses indicate that the misclassification error rate was 13% and residual mean deviance was 0.72.\\n\\n# CART 2 Model\\n\\nFigure 7 represents the final CART model for positive incidence of cryptosporidiosis in a month, by LGA. The results indicate that when the SEIFA was between 892 and 945, and temperature was over 32°C (8 LGA, 8 months), the relative risk (RR) of cryptosporidiosis rose to 3.9 (mean morbidity: 390.6/100,000, standard deviation (SD): 310.5), compared to monthly average incidence of cryptosporidiosis. When the SEIFA was less than 892 (7 LGA, 9 months) the RR of cryptosporidiosis was 4.3 (mean morbidity: 426.8/100,000, SD: 329.2), compared to the same baseline. No further splits were found to substantially improve the homogeneity of the subgroup outcome of non-zero incidence. The validation analyses indicate that the residual plots appear reasonably well.\\n\\n# CART 3 Model\\n\\nFigure 8 represents the final CART model which indicates that an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis, defined as exceeding the third quartile of the incidence rates, was best explained by SEIFA. The analysis indicates that there was a 100% chance for an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis if the SEIFA was less than 892 (7 LGA, 9 months) or the SEIFA was between 933 and 941 (4 LGA, 5 months) during an epidemic period. There was a 60% chance...\\n\\n# Table 1: Descriptive Statistics of Monthly Cryptosporidiosis and Social Economic and Weather Variables by LGA in Queensland\\n\\n|Variable|Mean|SD|Minimum|Q1|Median|Q3|Maximum|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cryptosporidiosis incidence (1/100,000)|15.11|69.07|0.00|0.00|0.00|1161.67|1332|\\n|Maximum temperature (°C)|28.17|4.61|16.54|24.55|28.48|31.49|40.11|\\n|Total rainfall (mm)|59.64|80.18|0.00|14.44|40.26|72.70|916.60|\\n|SEIFA|934.17|43.17|831.36|907.28|928.56|963.04|1059.84|\\n\\n* Q1: first quartile value; Q3: third quartile value.\\n\\n&copy; 2023 Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis Incidence\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nHu et al.

Therefore, from a public health perspective, there is a pressing need to control and prevent this disease. Evidence suggests that education and behavior might be direct risk factors for cryptosporidiosis infection. Individuals with lower SEIFA levels often possess poor health knowledge regarding disease transmission and personal protection from waterborne diseases. Thus, it is crucial to educate people in lower SEIFA areas on how to avoid contracting this infection, especially during epidemic periods.\\n\\nCryptosporidium parvum thrives in warm waters of moderate salinity. Consequently, with changing weather patterns, the geographic range of cryptosporidiosis may also shift. For instance, severe weather events appear to correlate with outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis during hot summers in Brisbane and South Sydney, Australia. In New Zealand, the cryptosporidiosis rate was positively associated with temperatures in the current and previous month during summer and autumn. The autumn peak in cryptosporidiosis has been linked to increased recreational water use, swimming, and outdoor activities. Our research indicates that high temperatures (>32°C) significantly affect cryptosporidiosis incidence in LGAs with high SEIFA values.\\n\\n# Correlation Matrix\\n\\n|Factors|Incidences|Temperature (°C)|Rainfall (mm)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Temperature (°C)|0.349†|(-0.033)| |\\n|Rainfall (mm)|-0.008|0.346†|(0.378†)|\\n|SEIFA|-0.535†|-0.213†|0.018|\\n\\n*Coefficients for data without zero incidence, and for data with zero incidence in brackets; †: p < 0.01.\\n\\n&copy; 2023 Research on Cryptosporidiosis\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Cryptosporidiosis Analysis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n\\n# Analysis of Cryptosporidiosis Incidences\\n\\n# Seasonal Variation and Environmental Factors\\n\\nThis section presents the pairwise scatterplots illustrating the relationship between cryptosporidiosis incidences and various explanatory variables across different seasons.\\n\\nFigure 2: Pairwise scatterplot (with regression line) of cryptosporidiosis without zero incidences and explanatory variables.\\n\\nFigure 3: Pairwise scatterplot (with regression line) of cryptosporidiosis with zero incidences and explanatory variables.\\n\\n# Data Interpretation\\n\\nThe scatterplots demonstrate the correlation between cryptosporidiosis rates and environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall across different seasons.

Generalized additive models were employed to evaluate the age-specific effects of etiological and meteorological factors on prevalence. A long-term increasing prevalence with strong seasonality was observed. In those aged 0–5 years, disease risk increased rapidly with the positive rate of virus (rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus) in the 20–50% range. In those aged > 20 years, disease risk increased with the positive rate of adenovirus and bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni) until reaching 5%, and thereafter stayed stable. The mean temperature, relative humidity, temperature range, and rainfall were all related to two-month lag morbidity in the group aged 0–5 years. Disease risk increased with relative humidity between 67–78%. Synchronous climate affected the incidence in those aged >20 years. Mean temperature and rainfall showed U-shape associations with disease risk (with threshold 15 °C and 100 mm per month, respectively). Meanwhile, disease risk increased gradually with sunshine duration over 150 hours per month. However, no associations were found in the group aged 6–19 years. In brief, etiological and meteorological factors had age-specific effects on the prevalence of infectious diarrhoea in Jiangsu. Surveillance efforts are needed to prevent its spread.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nDiarrhoea kills about 525,000 children under 5 years each year worldwide. Infectious diarrhoea remains a substantial public health problem, particularly in developing countries. In China, it has been listed as a legal Class C infectious disease and also the second leading notifiable disease with an incidence of 93.10 per 100,000. This disease occurs in all age groups, especially in children under 5 years.\\n\\nInfectious diarrhoea morbidity varies temporally and spatially. For example, it peaks in December-January in Guangdong province, August in Zhejiang province, and July-August and November-December in Shanxi province. The annual incidence in each region also differs. However, previous studies did not analyse the factors influencing infectious diarrhoea in their respective areas. Jiangsu Province, which is located in the eastern coastal areas of China, has shown an increasing incidence of infectious diarrhoea. It is therefore necessary to explore the epidemiological characteristics and the factors influencing this trend to inform targeted prevention and control.\\n\\nAge-specific morbidity of infectious diarrhoea could be related to pathogen type and climate. In particular, infectious diarrhoea is mainly caused by bacteria and viruses, which predominate differently in diverse populations and the prevalence of pathogens may influence age-specific morbidity differently. Studies have shown that meteorological factors exert different lag effects on diarrhoea in different regions. Climate may also influence human behaviour and epidemics of pathogens, which may further influence the prevalence of diarrhoea. Wei et al. found that climate was differentially associated with diarrhoea morbidity in various age groups in Taiwan. Nonetheless, to date, no study has investigated the lagged relationship between climate and age-specific morbidity nor quantified the age-specific effect of etiological and meteorological factors on infectious diarrhoea.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nIn this study, we first illustrated the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diarrhoea in Jiangsu Province from 2013 to 2017 and further explored the potential lagged relationship between the prevalence of pathogens, climate, and other factors.\\n\\n1School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211166, China.\\n\\n2Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, 210009, China.\\n\\n3NHC Key laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Nanjing, 210009, China.\\n\\n4These authors contributed equally: Xinyu Fang, Jing Ai and Wendong Liu.\\n\\n*Email: bao2000_cn@163.com\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Infectious Diarrhoea in Jiangsu Province\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper on Infectious Diarrhoea in Jiangsu Province (2013-2017)\\n\\nPublished in Nature Scientific Reports\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis study investigates the epidemiology, aetiology, and meteorological factors associated with infectious diarrhoea in Jiangsu Province, China.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Epidemiology of Infectious Diarrhoea\\n\\nA total of 86,885 cases of infectious diarrhoea (representing a morbidity of 21.83/100,000 per year) were reported during 2013–2017 in Jiangsu. Cases aged 0–2 years accounted for 54.93% (47,725/86,885) of all cases. The morbidity in males (25.07/100,000) was higher than that in females (18.55/100,000) (χ² = 1939.869, P < 0.01), with a ratio of 1.35:1.\\n\\nThe morbidity showed a long-term increasing trend with two annual peaks: a higher peak from November to January and a relatively lower peak from July to September. The population was clustered into three age groups: 0–5 years, 6–19 years, and >20 years. The incidence in the 0–5 and 6–19 age groups increased mainly in winter and spring, peaking in December for the 0–5 age group and in December and March for the 6–19 age group. In contrast, morbidity peaked in July-August for those aged over 20 years.\\n\\nThree high endemic regions were identified: Xuzhou, Yancheng, and the border area between Wuxi and Suzhou, with incidences ranging from 0.92 to 155.39 per 100,000 at the county level. Yunlong district in Xuzhou had the highest incidence (155.39 per 100,000).\\n\\n# Aetiology and Climate Characteristics\\n\\nA total of 1,193 positive specimens were detected out of 6,640 specimens, resulting in a positive rate of 17.97%. The virus positive rate was 14.43%, mainly from norovirus (7.52%) and rotavirus (5.36%). The bacterium positive rate was 3.95%, primarily from Salmonella (1.82%) and Escherichia coli (1.46%).\\n\\nPathogens were clustered into two classes based on their seasonality: Class 1 (adenovirus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni) and Class 2 (rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus). Class 1 pathogens were prevalent from June to September, while Class 2 pathogens were more common from November to March.\\n\\nBasic information on meteorological factors is provided in the supplementary file. Latent multicollinearity was detected between mean temperature and rainfall (r_s = 0.80, P < 0.01), relative humidity and rainfall (r = 0.76, P < 0.01), and relative humidity and temperature range (r_s = -0.86, P < 0.01).\\n\\n# Cross-Correlation Analyses\\n\\nThe prevalence of Class 1 pathogens positively correlated with disease morbidity in the 0–5 age group (r_s = 0.47, P = 0.01). Class 2 pathogens showed a positive correlation with disease morbidity in those aged over 20 years (r_s = 0.43, P < 0.01), while no correlation was observed in the 6–19 age group.\\n\\nMean temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall were positively related to morbidity with a two-month lag in the 0–5 age group, while a negative correlation was found with temperature range. Rainfall negatively correlated with incidence in the 0–5 age group but positively correlated with two-month lag incidence. Notably, morbidity in those aged over 20 years demonstrated strong positive correlations with mean temperature, sunshine duration, and rainfall, along with a two-month lag negative correlation with relative humidity. No correlation was found between meteorological factors and disease morbidity in the 6–19 age group.\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2019) 9:19571 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56207-2\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Infectious Diarrhoea Incidence\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper on Infectious Diarrhoea Incidence in Jiangsu Province\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports, 2019\\n\\n# Figures\\n\\nFigure 2.

It was more prevalent in Xuzhou, Yancheng, and the border area between Wuxi and Suzhou. The prevalence was higher in males and differed largely with age. Infants aged 0–2 years showed the highest morbidity and accounted for nearly 60% of all cases, consistent with other reports.\\n\\nPathogens of infectious diarrhoea were divided into two classes according to their prevalence seasonality (Class 1 and Class 2, were epidemic during June-September and November to next March, respectively). Seasonal variation of morbidity indicated that the epidemic intensity of Class 2 pathogens gradually strengthened, while the epidemic of Class 1 pathogens weakened.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nPreventive efforts should be strengthened for Class 2 pathogens in winter. In 2017, the average monthly cases of infectious disease increased and became more pronounced during the winter season.

Thus, measures to safeguard water quality are necessary. In the group aged 6–19 years, infectious diarrhoea occurred in multiple months and presented two seasonal peaks in December and March. However, no significant associations were detected between disease prevalence and etiological and meteorological factors. Two main reasons may account for this. First, the cases in this age group only accounted for 11.71% of all cases, making it hard to detect the association. Second, a variety of pathogens were detected in this age group. It can be concluded that the pathogen spectrum in Jiangsu is so wide that the relationship between a single class pathogen’s prevalence and meteorological factors could not be found.\\n\\nThis study has some limitations. First, not all of the infectious diarrhoea cases were validated in the laboratory, so we do not have complete etiological data. Second, people with mild infectious diarrhoea may not seek medical care and remain unreported, leading to biases in the incidence of the disease.'),\n",

Second, people with mild infectious diarrhoea may not seek medical care and remain unreported, leading to biases in the incidence of the disease.\\n\\nIn summary, we described the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diarrhoea and identified the basic components of the infectious diarrhoea pathogen spectrum in Jiangsu Province. It is beneficial to carry out targeted prevention and control and pathogen monitoring in high-incidence populations and areas. We also comprehensively illustrated the age-specific effects of etiological and meteorological factors on infectious diarrhoea, which are crucial to predict morbidity and develop adaptation strategies.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Study Area\\n\\nJiangsu Province is located in the eastern part of China (latitude 30°46′–35°08′N and longitude 116°21′–121°54′E), consisting of 13 cities (108 counties) and a population of about 80 million.\\n\\n# Data Source\\n\\nIn China, infectious diarrhoea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid) is an intestinal infectious disease with diarrhoea and/or vomiting as the main symptom. Data on monthly infectious diarrhoea morbidity during 2013–2017 in Jiangsu Province were collected from the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS). The information included gender, age, address, and date of onset.\\n\\nThrough multi-stage sampling, we selected 26 hospitals to examine the prevalence of infectious diarrhoea from Wuxi, Xuzhou, and Nantong (cities of Jiangsu). Stool specimens were collected to conduct bacteria culture and virus nucleic acid detection (Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Real-time PCR). We tested the level of rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni in each sample.\\n\\nMonthly climate data were obtained from the National Meteorological Information Center. It included mean temperature, temperature range, relative humidity, sunshine duration, and rainfall.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\nDescriptive statistics were employed to illustrate the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diarrhoea, etiological, and meteorological factors. Seasonal decomposition was applied to analyse incidence time series. Ordinary kriging interpolation was employed to spatially visualize disease incidence. Seasonal index (SI) was calculated to signify the seasonality of infectious diarrhoea in various populations and pathogens.\\n\\nCross-correlation analysis was then used to measure the association between the etiological and meteorological factors and zero to two monthly lagged morbidity in each age group. To assess for potential multicollinearity of meteorological factors, Spearman’s correlation coefficients were also calculated between climate factors. If the absolute value of rs (i.e. |r|) between related meteorological factors was >0.7, separate models were considered for subsequent quantitative analysis. The optimal model was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion for quantitative analysis of factors.\\n\\nFinally, the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was employed to quantify the age-specific effect of highly correlated etiological and meteorological factors on infectious diarrhoea in various age groups to avoid potential confounding.\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2019) 9:19571 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56207-2\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper on Diarrhea Surveillance in Jiangsu Province\\n\\nPublished: xx xx xxxx\\n\\nReceived: 12 February 2019; Accepted: 4 December 2019; Published online: 20 December 2019\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThe Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were specified as follows:\\n\\nlog[ ( E Yt)] = α + stl(df) + sts(df) + s(meteorological variables)(df)\\n\\nlog[ ( E Yt)] = α + stl(df) + sts(df) + s(etiological variables)(df)\\n\\nWhere Yt represents the monthly number of cases in various groups, E(Y) represents the expected value of Y, α represents the model intercept, and s() represents penalized smoothing spline.

Weather parameters at nearby locations are often used as a proxy, but the accuracy of this practice is not known.\\n\\nMethods: Daily Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium cases across England and Wales were linked to local temperature and rainfall at the residence postcodes of the patients and at the corresponding postcodes of the laboratory where the patient’s specimen was tested. The paired values of daily rainfall and temperature for the laboratory versus residence postcodes were interpolated from weather station data, and the results were analysed for agreement using linear regression. We also assessed potential dependency of the findings on the relative geographic distance between the patient’s residence and the laboratory.\\n\\nResults: There was significant and strong agreement between the daily values of rainfall and temperature at diagnostic laboratories with the values at the patient residence postcodes for samples containing the pathogens Campylobacter or Cryptosporidium. For rainfall, the R-squared was 0.96 for the former and 0.97 for the latter, and for maximum daily temperature, the R-squared was 0.99 for both. The overall mean distance between the patient residence and the laboratory was 11.9 km; however, the distribution of these distances exhibited a heavy tail, with some rare situations where the distance between the patient residence and the laboratory was larger than 500 km. These large distances impact the distributions of the weather variable discrepancies (i.e. the differences between weather parameters estimated at patient residence postcodes and those at laboratory postcodes), with discrepancies up to ±10 °C for the minimum and maximum temperature and 20 mm for rainfall. Nevertheless, the distributions of discrepancies (estimated separately for minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall), based on the cases where the distance between the patient residence and the laboratory was within 20 km, still exhibited tails somewhat longer than the corresponding exponential fits suggesting modest small scale variations in temperature and rainfall.\\n\\nCorrespondence: Abdelmajid.Djennad@phe.gov.uk\\n\\nPublic Health England, London, UK\\n\\nStatistics, Modelling and Economics Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England, 61, Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5EQ, UK\\n\\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

BMC Infectious Diseases (2018)\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Djennad et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2018) 18:198\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe findings confirm that, for the purposes of studying the relationships between meteorological variables and infectious diseases using data based on laboratory postcodes, the weather results are sufficiently similar to justify the use of laboratory postcode as a surrogate for domestic postcode. Exclusion of the small percentage of cases where there is a large distance between the residence and the laboratory could increase the precision of estimates, but there are generally strong associations between daily weather parameters at residence and laboratory.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Temperature, Rainfall, Data linkage, SGSS, MEDMI, MIDAS\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nWeather can contribute significantly to the occurrence of many infectious diseases, and high spatial resolution of exposure data has increasingly been recognized as a requirement in quantifying these relationships [1]. These analyses can help in understanding the likely changes in infectious diseases that may take place in the future through climate or other environmental change [2, 3], particularly in determining the drivers for change [4, 5], in the application of suitable models, and for designing interventions [6]. Variations in diseases by country have been used to examine the impact of weather that is separated from geography [7, 8]. For example, environmental weather parameters at low resolution (e.g. national average) have been used as a proxy for the weather experienced by an individual. The methods of collection for a range of different weather parameters differ, often based on comparatively few weather stations with limited interpolation of the data at other locations or because the exact location of the exposed individual is not known.\\n\\nTo understand the impacts of weather (and the general environment) on both communicable and non-communicable diseases, it is therefore desirable to have information on the weather parameters as close as possible to the location of people’s residence. This is not always possible for a variety of reasons. Datasets from different agencies are seldom linked together, although important efforts to integrate heterogeneous datasets have been made (see the MEDMI project at https://www.data-mashup.org.uk). With the movement of reported geographic data from the local to the national to the international infectious disease surveillance records [9], the geographic resolution can be ‘lost’ in this process. For example, records from diagnostic microbiology laboratories for England and Wales in the Public Health England Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) database have had limited patient postcode data before 2008. Furthermore, the computational resources needed for data linkage at the individual patient postcode level can be significant if large infectious disease datasets are being interrogated. As an example, a study found over a million Campylobacter infections recorded in England and Wales [10]. The linkage with patient postcodes also presents challenges to comply with ethical and legal requirements of confidentiality [11], with insufficient evidence about the efficacy of some anonymisation methods [12].\\n\\nThese concerns are particularly relevant for the increasing number of initiatives aiming to integrate data from different sources (e.g. big data mashups), particularly the linkage of human health data with environmental data needed to study the effects of climate and other environmental change on human diseases [13–15]. This study sought to test whether the linkage of weather parameters in England and Wales to the diagnostic laboratory postcodes for daily Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium cases across England and Wales reported to Public Health England would be suitable for use as a proxy for the weather at the patient’s residence postcode. The linkage of interpolated local weather parameters supplied by the UK Met Office with the postcodes of the diagnostic laboratories instead of with patient residence postcodes would address many of the concerns above.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Infectious diseases data\\n\\nThe Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) database of Public Health England was used to extract daily individual records of Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium infections from 01/01/2005 to 31/12/2014 using specimen date, domestic residence postcodes and laboratory postcodes. There are approximately 11,200 postcode sectors in the UK, each containing approximately 3000 addresses, the size of the postcode sectors varies, ranging from 2864 km2 in a low populated region in the Scottish Highlands to approximately 0.001 km2 in most of the densely populated sectors of London (according to BPH Postcodes at https://www.bph-postcodes.co.uk/guidetopc.cgi). The two pathogens were chosen because they were thought to be transmitted by different routes (Campylobacter from chicken and Cryptosporidium from faecal contamination of water); and have a different seasonality (Campylobacter peaks in late spring and Cryptosporidium in late summer) and may therefore be subject to different weather influences (although the postcode relationships to weather were...\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidium and Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidium and Campylobacter Infections\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the relationship between meteorological data and the incidence of Cryptosporidium and Campylobacter infections, focusing on the influence of rainfall and temperature on these waterborne diseases.\\n\\n# Introduction'),\n",

The overall mean patient-laboratory distance was 11.9 km (standard deviation = 19.8 km), but the distribution exhibited a heavy tail with some instances where the distance exceeded 500 km.\\n\\n# Temperature and Rainfall Discrepancies\\n\\nFigure 4 (a, c, and e) illustrates the distributions of the differences in minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall registered at the laboratory and patient addresses. The distributions exhibited a tail heavier than the corresponding exponential fit, with differences up to ±10 °C for temperature and ±20 mm for rainfall.\\n\\nTo test if the heavy-tailed distributions arose from exceptional instances of large patient-laboratory distances, we compared the distributions based on the entire dataset with those based on cases where the patient-laboratory distances were lower than 20 km.

Gridded datasets that use the IDW method with statistical adjustments for known atmospheric effects have been used by some researchers, but unadjusted IDW interpolation provides a more spatially localized estimate than taking a single value for a region or a country, or simply by taking the measurements from nearby weather stations.\\n\\nThe analysis is straightforward and applicable to situations resembling the same circumstances in England and Wales, i.e., regions with the same climatic zones such as regions in the same Koppen-Geiger classification, and with similar public health capacity and spatial density.\\n---\\n# Distribution of Patient-Laboratory Distances\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 5px;\\n}\\n\\n# Distribution of Patient-Laboratory Distances\\n\\nPanel a: Geographic location of diagnostic laboratories in England and Wales.

Pathogen prevalence is often described as seasonal, peaking annually and associated with specific weather conditions. Although many studies have described the seasonality of diarrheal disease, these studies have occurred predominantly in temperate regions. In tropical and resource-constrained settings, where nearly all diarrhea-associated mortality occurs, the seasonality of many diarrheal pathogens has not been well characterized. As a retrospective study, we analyze the seasonal prevalence of diarrheal pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) over three years from the seven sites of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a case–control study. Using data from this expansive study on diarrheal disease, we characterize the seasonality of different pathogens, their association with site-specific weather patterns, and consistency across study sites.\\n\\n# Methodology/Principal Findings\\n\\nUsing traditional methodologies from signal processing, we found that certain pathogens peaked at the same time every year, but not at all sites. We also found associations between pathogen prevalence and weather or “seasons,” which are defined by applying modern machine-learning methodologies to site-specific weather data. In general, rotavirus was most prevalent during the drier “winter” months and out of phase with bacterial pathogens, which peaked during hotter and rainier times of year corresponding to “monsoon,” “rainy,” or “summer” seasons.\\n\\n# Conclusions/Significance\\n\\nIdentifying the seasonally-dependent prevalence for diarrheal pathogens helps characterize the local epidemiology and inform the clinical diagnosis of symptomatic children. Our multi-site, multi-continent study indicates a complex epidemiology of pathogens that does not reveal an easy generalization that is consistent across all sites. Instead, our study indicates the necessity of local data to characterizing the epidemiology of diarrheal disease.\\n\\nCitation: Chao DL, Roose A, Roh M, Kotloff KL, Proctor JL (2019) The seasonality of diarrheal pathogens: A retrospective study of seven sites over three years.

It is difficult to determine which of a wide variety of pathogens are most responsible for disease, since this differs by location and time of year. Here, we study the seasonal prevalence of several pathogens among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea across study sites in Africa and South Asia. We found that several pathogens, including rotavirus, had regular annual peaks. Some pathogens were associated with weather conditions, such as heat or rain, or with general seasons of the year, such as summer or winter. We believe that describing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable better diagnoses of symptomatic children based on the time of the year. Additionally, weather can be a major driver of diarrheal pathogen transmission, and identifying the conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPediatric diarrheal disease is caused by a wide variety of pathogens [1–3]. Various studies have found that some pathogens are seasonal, peaking at different times of the year [4–6]. Frequently, the seasonal periodicity of diarrheal disease is attributed to weather, which could drive incidence by diverse mechanisms. For example, weather conditions can favor the survival and replication of pathogens on fomites [7], the transmission between human hosts through flooding and contamination of drinking water [8], and the prevalence of vectors that transmit disease between hosts [9, 10]. Weather has been shown to be statistically correlated with infectious diseases incidence including diarrhea from pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae and rotavirus [11, 12].\\n\\nHowever, most studies of disease seasonality have been conducted in temperate climates, and substantially less is known about the seasonality of diseases in tropical countries [13, 14], where diarrheal disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children [15]. The wide variety of climates and variations in populations in the tropics make it challenging to uncover general patterns in the epidemiology of diarrheal disease. Compounding these challenges, most studies are limited to sites within a single country focused on a specific disease. Characterizing the seasonal epidemiology of these pathogens could enable clinicians to better diagnose children based on the time of the year. Additionally, identifying the weather conditions associated with each pathogen could help us infer pathogen transmission pathways, predict large outbreaks, and develop intervention strategies.\\n\\nIn this article, we perform a secondary analysis of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a large, multi-country study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) among children younger than five years of age [2], to investigate the underlying patterns of pathogen-specific seasonality for diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.

Fortnights are defined as consecutive 14-day periods starting with the first enrollment at each site, so there were about 80 fortnights of data per study site.\\n\\nFor example, Fig 1(A) illustrates the difference between rotavirus confirmed enrolled children (purple) and the total estimated rotavirus prevalence among eligible children (black lines) in Bangladesh. Thus, the overall estimated pathogen prevalence includes the laboratory-positive children among the enrolled plus the estimated proportion among the eligible, reflecting the true age distribution of MSD cases. Fig 1(A) does not show a large difference between confirmed rotavirus cases and estimated rotavirus cases due to the small differences between the number of eligible and enrolled children. S1 Fig for the Mali study site illustrates a wider difference between the number of eligible and enrolled children, resulting in a wider discrepancy between confirmed and estimated rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# Weather Data for GEMS Study Sites\\n\\nDaily historical weather data from weather stations were acquired from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD). These data include daily measurements of temperature, precipitation, and dew point. For some GEMS study sites, the closest weather station does not have complete data for the entire study interval (2007–2011). In these cases, we choose the closest weather station with nearly complete data; for example, the weather station for The Gambia site is in Tambacounda, Senegal which is approximately 77 kilometers away and is the largest distance between site and station used in this study.\\n\\nRelative humidity was computed using the following empirical relationship, originally defined by Bosen in 1958:\\n\\nRH = 100 × ((112 - (0.1 × T) + DP) / (112 + (0.9 × T)))^8\\n\\nwhere T is temperature in Celsius, DP is dewpoint in Celsius, and RH is relative humidity.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Child Enrollment by Fortnight in the Bangladesh Study Site\\n\\nFig 1.

Days with missing rainfall data were assumed to have no rainfall, while days with missing temperature or humidity data were excluded from average calculations.\\n\\n# Detecting Periodicity and Relative Phase in Disease Incidence Time Series\\n\\nTo estimate the seasonality of each pathogen, we employed standard time series analysis techniques, including power spectral density methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Fast Fourier transforms. These methods have been previously utilized for disease incidence analysis.\\n\\nThe Lomb-Scargle periodogram is particularly effective for analyzing constrained time series, allowing us to quantify the uncertainty of detecting specific periodicities even with unevenly sampled data. The results are illustrated in figures showing the spectral power for each resolvable frequency, including annual and biannual periods.\\n\\nFor each pathogen and site combination, we used the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract the relative phase of annual peaks in disease incidence. This transformation was performed with respect to the first day in the two-week period.\\n\\n# Identifying Associations Between Environmental Factors and Pathogens\\n\\nWe estimated the strength of association between weather covariates (cumulative precipitation, average temperature, average relative humidity, and average specific humidity) and the estimated number of children positive for each pathogen by country. Quartiles were used to identify the highest and lowest groups for the number of children with MSD positive by fortnight, due to low sample sizes for certain pathogens.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n#\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Annual Peak Dates of Pathogens\\n\\nWe used the phase information from the FFT of the number of eligible children estimated to be positive each fortnight to determine the date of the annual peak of each pathogen in each country (indicated as month–day in each square and color-coded by month of year). The significance (false-detection rate pfd) of the annual cycle was obtained from the Lomb–Scargle periodogram of the most significant period between 11 and 13 months, indicated by *** for <0.1%, ** for <1%, * for <5%, and • for <10%.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nIn these cases, the median could not be used to distinguish high and low prevalence, and the weather during fortnights with no positive cases was compared to the weather during fortnights with cases. The associations between pathogen prevalence and environmental values are computed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The computations were performed in the R scientific computing environment [22] and the code can be found in [21].\\n\\n# Identifying Data-Driven Seasons Directly from Weather Data\\n\\nWe identify seasons directly from the monthly weather data derived from GSOD, instead of using pre-defined seasons from the literature. These seasons are data-driven in the sense that our algorithm clusters months that have similar weather covariates. We transform daily environmental values to monthly values by summing rainfall and taking the average values for temperature, relative humidity, and specific humidity. However, the year-to-year variability has a substantial impact on the beginning and end of seasons; see S2 Fig for an illustration of the season variability when using actual weather data to identify seasons.\\n\\nTo define seasons using weather data, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of weather covariates from four to three. The dimensionality reduction with principal components analysis eliminates redundant variables [25]. In particular, since the four weather covariates studied were derived from only three measured weather-related variables, the PCA procedure reduced the dimensionality appropriately. We chose not to reduce dimensionality further, since the first two principal components only explained 88 to 96% of the variance in the weather data. We implemented k-means clustering to group weather–months by similarity; three clusters best described the groupings of weather–months.\\n\\nFig 1(C) shows each of the month’s weather data projected on the leading two principal components.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n#\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Data-Driven Seasons\\n\\nComponents colored by cluster. We call these clusters data-driven seasons. This procedure identified reasonable quantitative definitions of seasons that are generally consistent with those informally identified in previous publications (S3 Table). Some seasons can occur more than once per year, e.g., there can be two rainy seasons in one calendar year. Fig 1(D) illustrates the timing of seasons in Bangladesh. We used the R scientific computing environment [22] and provide the analysis code at the following repository [21].\\n\\n# Determining Significant Differences in Pathogen-Positive Cases by Season\\n\\nTo determine if the estimated number of children positive for pathogens each month had significant differences among our data-driven seasons, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test. We then used Dunn’s test to identify the pairs of seasons with significantly different numbers of children positive for pathogens. The tests were applied using the R scientific computing environment [22].\\n\\n# Ethics Approval\\n\\nThe GEMS study protocol was approved by ethics committees at the University of Maryland, Baltimore and at each field site. Parents or caregivers of participants provided written informed consent, and a witnessed consent was obtained for illiterate parents or caretakers.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Annual and Biannual Cycles Detected for Several Diarrheal Pathogens and Study Sites\\n\\nWe studied the periodicity of the estimated number of eligible children positive for eight pathogens: Campylobacter, Shigella, ST-ETEC, tEPEC, Cryptosporidium, rotavirus, and adenovirus 40/41. V. cholerae, norovirus GI, and GII did not have statistically significant annual seasonality at any of the sites. The number of children with MSD in Mali, Mozambique, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh had significant annual periodicity (pfd <10%) (Fig 2). Each of the seven sites had 1–5 pathogens with significant annual periodicity (pfd <10%). Rotavirus has significant annual periodicity in The Gambia, Mali, India, and Bangladesh (all pfd <1%). Cryptosporidium has significant annual periodicity (pfd <1%) in The Gambia, Mali, and Mozambique. Shigella (pfd <0.1%) and EAEC (pfd <1%) had significant annual periodicity only in Bangladesh. Fig 3 plots the number of study-eligible children (children with MSD) visiting the clinics each fortnight and the estimated number of them positive for rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Shigella. ST-ETEC and tEPEC had significant annual periodicity at pfd <1% only in Mozambique. We also tested for 6-month periodicity (5.5–6.5 month period) using the same procedure as above. Of the seven sites, only Kenya had pathogens with a significant 6-month periodicity: rotavirus and norovirus GII (pfd <10%).\\n\\n# Broad Statistical Association Between Fortnightly Pathogen Prevalence and Weather'),\n",

Hot weather was also associated with high numbers of Shigella-positive cases (Fig 4). ST-ETEC, tEPEC, and V. cholerae were associated with hot and humid weather. Rainy and humid fortnights had significantly more Cryptosporidium-positive cases than dry fortnights.\\n\\n# Site-specific Seasons Identified from Weather Data\\n\\nWe identified three data-driven seasons for each GEMS site using rainfall, temperature, and humidity data. Fig 1(C) illustrates the clustering of monthly weather data, collected from the various sites.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n#\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\n# Weather Data and Seasonal Clustering\\n\\nThe closest weather station in Bangladesh during 2008 to 2011 was analyzed and projected onto the first two principal components. The color of each month indicates the cluster (season) to which the month belongs. S2 Table summarizes average weather conditions for each season at each site. Fig (1D) illustrates how the clustering is reflected temporally during the study time period. This methodology allows for seasons to vary in duration and initiation time and is based on site-specific weather data from the duration of study enrollment (S2 Fig).\\n\\nWe attached labels to these data-driven seasons to aid in interpretability. The labeling procedure consists of two components: the characteristics arising from clustering the weather data and region-specific characteristics. For example, periods encompassing the times of year with the most rainfall were labeled “Monsoon” in regions that experience monsoons and “Rainy” elsewhere. The hottest periods of the year were labeled “Summer” and the coldest periods “Winter” when those terms are used in the region; otherwise, the labels “Hot” and “Cool” were assigned. We used descriptive names in some cases, such as “Hot/dry.” The seasons were generally consistent with those described in prior publications (S3 Table). Because the seasons were identified separately for each site, the actual weather for the same season label across sites could be quite different. Note that season labels are internally consistent within a site (e.g., “Summer” is always hotter than “Winter” at a site), but not across sites (“Summer” at one site might be cooler than “Summer” at another) (S2 Table).\\n\\n# Pathogen Prevalence and Seasonal Variation\\n\\nPathogen prevalence is strongly associated with data-driven seasons. We found rotavirus tended to have significantly higher prevalence in winter or cool/dry seasons than during rainy seasons (Fig 5). For example, the estimated rotavirus prevalence in The Gambia was significantly lower during the rainy compared to the two other seasons, but not statistically different between the cool/dry and hot/dry season. We did not find a country–pathogen combination with statistically different prevalences among all three seasons. We found Shigella was most prevalent during the summer in Bangladesh and the hot/dry season in Mali (Fig 5). ST-ETEC was most prevalent during the rainy season in The Gambia and Mozambique and the summer and monsoon seasons in Bangladesh and India. Cryptosporidium had highest prevalence in the rainy season in The Gambia, Mali, and Mozambique. Bacterial pathogens and Cryptosporidium had lower prevalence in winter or cool/dry seasons than in rainy or summer seasons.\\n\\n# Age-Related Pathogen Prevalence\\n\\nThe most prevalent pathogens differ by season and child age. Because different pathogens were associated with different seasons, the relative prevalence (and ranking) of pathogens among children with MSD differed by season. Among children 0 to 23 months old, rotavirus was the pathogen most frequently detected among eligible children in the winter, dry, or cool/dry seasons at all sites (22–57% of cases, Fig 6, left panel). In the rainy or monsoon months, rotavirus was less dominant, and Shigella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium were the most often detected. Among those 24 to 59 months old, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen at three of the seven sites in winter or cool/dry seasons (Fig 6, right panel). For these older children, V. cholerae is one of the top three pathogens at some sites during the monsoon or summer seasons.'),\n",

If MSD or pathogen associated with MSD has a highly significant annual period, the age at which a child is most likely to get diarrhea depends on the birth month of a child. For example, if diarrheal disease peaks in the first quarter of the year, a child born in the second quarter might not be at high risk until six to nine months of age, while a child born before the first quarter may be at higher risk.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nFig 5.

Recent studies indicate that rotavirus seasonality may be less pronounced in tropical climates, with evidence suggesting peaks during cooler and drier seasons. The introduction of rotavirus vaccines may mitigate the annual peaks in diarrheal diseases associated with this pathogen.\\n\\nOur research found inconsistent periodicity of other pathogens across GEMS sites, highlighting a gap in the scientific literature regarding the global seasonality of diarrheal pathogens beyond rotavirus. We hypothesized that weather influences the transmission of many diarrheal pathogens at GEMS sites, and the absence of significant annual periodicity may stem from the milder and more variable weather conditions typical of tropical regions.\\n\\nDespite the lack of significant annual periodicity in pathogen prevalence time series, we identified associations between the prevalence of diarrheal pathogens and weather conditions. Several bacterial pathogens were more prevalent during hot and rainy weather, which may facilitate bacterial growth in the environment or lead to water source contamination. For instance, ST-ETEC was generally associated with warmer weather in Mozambique, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh, aligning with previous observations linking ETEC to higher temperatures, though not rainfall.\\n\\nWe also found a significant association between Cryptosporidium prevalence and rainy weather in The Gambia, Mali, and Mozambique, consistent with findings that precipitation may drive cryptosporidiosis in tropical regions. Conversely, rotavirus prevalence was higher during the drier winter months, contrasting with Cryptosporidium, which aligns with reviews of rotavirus seasonality studies in tropical areas. Some studies have noted secondary peaks of rotavirus activity during monsoon seasons in tropical settings.\\n\\nOur findings for Bangladesh corroborate the analysis by Das et al., which reported that rotavirus peaked in winter, cholera during the monsoon, and ETEC in summer at three sites in Bangladesh. However, identifying the specific weather components driving each pathogen is challenging due to the high correlation among weather covariates, such as heat and humidity.\\n\\nWe categorized the weather conditions at each site into distinct classes, such as \"warm, humid, and rainy,\" \"hot and dry,\" and \"cool and rainy,\" which correspond to informally identified site-specific seasons like \"summer\" and \"winter.\" Utilizing modern machine-learning techniques, we formalized this observation and clustered environmental data by site to identify data-driven seasons. This approach represents an innovative method for associating pathogen prevalence with site-specific weather patterns.\\n\\nOur analysis revealed that pathogen prevalence often varied significantly across these seasons, suggesting that the lack of strict annual periodicity may be attributed to year-to-year variability in the timing and duration of seasons. We propose that these defined seasons serve multiple purposes in studying pathogen associations with weather conditions: 1) Seasons last several months, making associations more robust to disease reporting lags and frequency; 2) Some pathogens may be influenced by a combination of weather conditions (e.g., heat and humidity), which are captured by seasons rather than individual weather covariates; and 3) Seasons provide a common terminology for use across different sites.\\n\\nThe site-specific seasons defined in this study enable public health officials and clinicians to better understand changes in pathogen prevalence across seasons. For example, among children aged 0 to 23 months, rotavirus was the most frequently detected pathogen, particularly during winter or cool/dry seasons. Cryptosporidium was the leading pathogen during the rainy season in some countries for this age group. In children aged 24 to 59 months, Campylobacter, Shigella, and ST-ETEC were the most frequently detected pathogens. Detailed site-specific descriptions could enhance differential diagnosis and treatment choices for affected populations.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007211 | August 15, 2019\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Diarrheal Pathogens\\n\\nPatients with diarrhea may not receive laboratory services, complicating diagnosis. The GEMS 1A study found a similar spectrum of pathogens among children with less severe diarrhea at the GEMS sites [37].\\n\\nThe timing of seasons can shift from year to year, which could complicate their use in clinical decision-making. However, we believe that by assigning seasons intuitive names, giving the approximate dates of the seasons, and describing the general weather conditions associated with each season, a local clinician could identify the appropriate season when making diagnoses. These weather-defined seasons were not optimized for studying disease epidemiology. A simpler classification of seasons, such as rainy vs dry season, could be easier to use in practice for some pathogens.\\n\\nFor sites with strong annual rotavirus seasonality, the birth month of a child is associated with age-dependent risk of rotavirus diarrhea. A similar result was reported in a study of rotavirus in England and Wales, a high-income country, where children born in the summer had a higher risk of rotavirus diarrhea in the first year of life compared to those born in the winter [38]. Broadly, this data and analysis can be used to assess the risk of a diarrheal disease by birth month; from a public health perspective, these results could be included in supply chain and operational planning for clinics and hospitals.\\n\\nThe smaller seasonal changes in temperature and humidity in some tropical settings compared to temperate ones could make it difficult to study weather as a driver of diarrheal disease. We found the association between pathogens and weather is less pronounced at sites with less seasonal variation in weather, such as the study sites in Kenya and Mozambique. Because temperate and tropical climates have different ranges of weather conditions, the relationship between pathogens and weather covariates could differ [39]. Shorter seasons may make detecting the association between weather and pathogens difficult, since the pathogen would have less time to respond (e.g., amplify, transmit) to changes in weather conditions. The Kenya site has two rainy and two dry seasons per year, thus weather covariates had bi-annual rather than annual periodicity, and rotavirus and norovirus GII prevalence had significant bi-annual periodicity, but previous studies noted that the seasonality of rotavirus disease is subtle in Kenya [40].\\n\\nWeather might also mediate complex transmission pathways [12]; for example, Shigella had been observed to peak in April–June at the GEMS study site in Bangladesh and was associated with seasonal peaks in housefly density in February and March [41]. Therefore, peaks in disease prevalence could be driven by the weather during a preceding season. This in part motivated our decision to define seasons at a monthly resolution instead of a finer weekly or bi-weekly scale. Weather’s effects on pathogen transmission may also interact with population density, so that adjacent urban and rural areas can experience differing pathogen seasonality [34], which could make it difficult to generalize the relationships between weather and pathogen prevalences. The effects of weather on infection can be affected by other socioeconomic factors. For example, Bhavnani et al found that heavy rainfall could increase the risk of diarrhea in households with unimproved water sources but that dry conditions could increase the risk of diarrhea in households with unimproved sanitation [42]. We only made empirical observations about the relationship between weather and children presenting with MSD without considering causality. We also need to consider the factors that influence care-seeking behavior and how representative the cases we measured are of the general population and of the most vulnerable sub-populations [43].\\n\\nIt is mathematically challenging to determine if a pathogen is causally associated with seasonal environmental factors. This study used three years of observations, so variation in weather between years could mitigate the confounding of climate and calendar-based covariates [11, 12].

We did not, however, attempt to identify causally linked environmental factors. There is the potential that additional years of data or spatial weather covariates within sites could further improve our ability to link weather to disease prevalence, particularly if years with extreme weather are included [44]. More sensitive pathogen detection assays could also improve our ability to analyze seasonality. A recent reanalysis of a subset of the samples from GEMS revealed higher prevalence of some pathogens among cases, particularly Shigella, adenovirus 40/41, ST-ETEC, and Campylobacter [19]. Even with more sensitive assays and longer time series, determining the etiology of diarrheal disease is difficult, since multi-pathogen infections are common and disease could be caused by (or even mitigated by) one of the pathogens. We primarily focused on pathogens that have strong associations with diarrhea (e.g., low minimum infectious dose) to mitigate this challenge. One result of this work is to provide caution to the global health community, especially given the current trend of estimating burden at a fine-scale spatial resolution with an underlying statistical model that relies too heavily on data from a nonrepresentative region.\\n\\nNotwithstanding many of these limitations, our study was unique in studying the seasonality of multiple pathogens across multiple countries at the same time using the same study design. Although the primary purpose of GEMS was to identify the most prevalent and virulent pathogens associated with MSD at the study sites, the association of certain pathogens with weather covariates was strong enough to study. We believe that identifying the environmental conditions that facilitate transmission of pathogens could help us understand the mechanisms by which they spread in human populations and choose the most effective interventions to reduce transmission [42, 45–47]. We believe that this study will better inform the global health community around pathogen prevalence in different resource constrained settings. Moreover, the identification of age-dependent risk of pathogen and population prevalences by season could lead to better clinical diagnoses and allocation of public resources.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- S1 Checklist.

Campylobacter incidence is highly seasonal; the consistent peak in late spring suggests a role for meteorological factors in the epidemiology of this organism. We investigated the relationship between ambient temperature and Campylobacter enteritis using time-series analysis to study short-term associations between temperature and number of Campylobacter reports adjusted for longer-term trend and seasonal patterns. We found a linear relationship between mean weekly temperature and reported Campylobacter enteritis, with a 1°C rise corresponding to a 5% increase in the number of reports up to a threshold of 14°C. There was no relationship outside this temperature range. Our findings provide evidence that ambient temperature influences Campylobacter incidence, and suggest that its effect is likely to be indirect, acting through other intermediate pathways.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nOver 45,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of Campylobacter enteritis are reported in England and Wales each year and an estimated half a million community cases occur annually in England alone, making this the most common bacterial cause of gastrointestinal illness in this setting. The risk factors for Campylobacter enteritis, as identified by case-control studies and outbreak reports, are numerous and varied. They include consumption of inadequately cooked poultry, both in the home and in restaurants, barbecued meats, untreated water, unpasteurized milk, contact with pets, particularly puppies, and occupational and recreational exposure to farm animals. A large proportion of sporadic cases remain unexplained by commonly recognized risk factors.\\n\\nCampylobacter enteritis in temperate countries exhibits a distinctive seasonal pattern. A spring/summer peak in reported cases is typical. The exact timing of the peak varies between countries but displays remarkable consistency from year to year; in England and Wales, it occurs in late May/early June. The factors underlying this seasonality are unknown. Several hypotheses have been suggested.\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: C. C.

However, none of these factors have been definitively linked to human disease. The consistency of the seasonal pattern suggests that meteorological factors could play a role, either directly or indirectly influencing other pathways.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Laboratory Reports\\n\\nWe obtained weekly numbers of Campylobacter spp. infections reported in England between 1989 and 1999 from the national database of laboratory-confirmed infections. A total of 623,817 cases were reported during this period. To exclude travel-related cases, we used data from the England and Wales Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme, which collected self-reported exposure information from May 2000 to April 2003.\\n\\n# Meteorological Variables\\n\\nDaily time-series of meteorological variables were obtained from the Met Office (UK) and converted into mean weekly values. The climate variables included relative humidity, sunlight hours, and mean central England temperature (CET).\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nTime-series-adapted regression techniques were used to study short-term associations between mean weekly ambient temperature and Campylobacter reports, adjusting for trend, seasonal patterns, and public holidays. Negative binomial regression was employed to account for over-dispersion in the data.\\n\\n# Confounding by Temporal Factors\\n\\nThe primary question of interest was whether a change in ambient temperature in a given week was associated with a change in the number of Campylobacter reports weeks later. To address potential confounding by trend and seasonal patterns, we included indicator variables for year and Fourier terms up to the 6th harmonic in our model.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis study highlights the importance of considering meteorological factors in understanding the incidence of Campylobacter enteritis and suggests that further research is needed to elucidate the complex relationships between climate and infectious diseases.\\n\\nReferences: [13-23]\\n---\\n# Temperature Dependence of Campylobacter Infection\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n.chart {\\nwidth: 80%;\\nmargin: 0 auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature Dependence of Campylobacter Infection\\n\\n# Lag Effects\\n\\nTo account for delays in the effect of temperature on the number of reported cases, a lagged temperature variable was incorporated in the model. To identify the optimum lag period, we first assumed a linear relationship between temperature and Campylobacter reports. We performed sequential regressions of temperature on Campylobacter reports adjusted for trend, seasonality, and public holidays, adding one lag at a time to determine the linear contribution of each additional lag. Temperature was included in these regressions as the combined effect of all lags up to the lag of interest.\\n\\nFig. 1. Linear effect of temperature on Campylobacter spp. reports over lags 0–9. Each point indicates the combined effect of temperature in the corresponding lag and all preceding lags and represents the relative increase in the number of reports per 1 °C increase in temperature, assuming a linear relationship between temperature and Campylobacter reports. Models are adjusted for trend, seasonality (up to the 6th harmonic), public holidays, and relative humidity.\\n\\nA lag effect of up to 6 weeks was determined to be the optimum. The effect of each additional lag was approximately linear, i.e., each additional lag resulted in a similar increase in the relative risk.

The cubic functions are constrained to join at the break-points of each interval so that a smooth function is obtained over the whole temperature range.\\n\\nThis technique enables complex relationships to be modeled making better use of the available information and without making assumptions about the shape of the temperature–disease association. The number of break-points, or knots, used determines the level of smoothing of the data: the smaller the number of intervals, the smoother the function. A smooth function incorporating two knots was deemed to be the most appropriate using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). The choice of two knots was not crucial to the model, as regressions with up to five knots yielded similar (though less parsimonious) relationships.\\n\\nSimilarly, the effect of relative humidity was adjusted for by including natural cubic splines of the humidity series in the model. The full spline model thus included indicator variables for each year, Fourier terms up to the 8th harmonic, an indicator variable for weeks in which public holidays occurred, and splines of the mean temperature and relative humidity series with two and five knots respectively.\\n\\nHaving obtained a smooth function for the temperature–Campylobacter relationship, the model was then simplified by reducing this smooth function to linear terms. Based on the adjusted spline model, a linear model was assumed with a threshold at a certain temperature, beyond which temperature has no effect on the number of Campylobacter reports. Repeated regressions were carried out varying the threshold by 1 °C each time to find the break-point providing the best fit (as determined by AIC).\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Reports and Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 5px;\\n}\\n.results, .discussion {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on the Relationship Between Temperature and Campylobacter Reports\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nAfter adjusting for trend, seasonality, public holidays, and relative humidity, we found a linear relationship between mean ambient temperature in the previous 6-week period and reported Campylobacter enteritis up to a threshold of 14 °C, with a 1 °C rise corresponding to a 5% increase in the number of reports [relative risk (RR) 1.045, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.032–1.059].

Important alternative explanations for this apparent association include insufficient seasonal adjustment and inadequate control for meteorological or other time-varying variables. However, repeating the analysis with varying degrees of seasonal adjustment yielded similar results, and of the meteorological variables investigated, only relative humidity showed a weak relationship with Campylobacter reporting. The nature of this relationship was complex and nonlinear, and has not been characterized further.\\n\\nUsing the CSSS data to indirectly exclude travel-related cases could mean that some residual confounding due to cases who acquired infection abroad might remain.

The reason for this high variability is unclear, but it might be dependent on a number of factors. First, the use of specimen date introduces a variable lag (in most cases no more than 2 weeks) that is unrelated to temperature. Second, the use of mean CET as an aggregate temperature measure for the whole of England could have diluted the temperature effect. More detailed region-specific analyses might address this problem, albeit at the cost of statistical power. Third, the high variability may reflect the many sources and routes of transmission for Campylobacter, some of which might not be temperature-dependent. Even where temperature is involved, the effect is likely to be mediated through complex pathways.\\n\\nCampylobacter exhibits limited growth below 30 °C, so it is unlikely that temperature will have a direct effect on Campylobacter incidence over the temperature range that we have described. Our model suggests an effect of temperature up to a threshold of 14 °C. The biological significance of this threshold is unclear, and this value is likely to be subject to statistical variation. However, our results suggest that the effect of temperature may be exerted through more complex temperature-dependent mechanisms. One such mechanism could involve survival of Campylobacter in environmental water sources. There is considerable evidence that survival of campylobacters in aquatic environments is inversely related to water temperature and that reversion to a ‘viable but non-culturable’ (VNC) form can extend survival to several months. In some cases, infectivity of these VNC strains in rats and chicks has been demonstrated. In addition, extended survival of Campylobacter jejuni within Acanthamoeba polyphaga vacuoles at low water temperatures has been demonstrated under experimental conditions, suggesting a role for this waterborne protozoan in the ecology of Campylobacter.\\n\\nDespite the numerous outbreaks of waterborne Campylobacter enteritis described in the literature, case-control studies have not found water contact to be a major transmission route for sporadic cases. This may partly be due to the difficulty in quantifying these exposures, which, in addition, may only be harmful intermittently; if water contact is a risk factor only under certain temperature conditions, studies that do not take into account the interaction between water contact and season might not detect this. Alternatively, water sources could be an important factor in the environmental spread of Campylobacter, while not necessarily being a direct source of infection. Under this model, aquatic survival of Campylobacter at lower temperatures would result in spread to wildlife and farm animals, leading to an amplification cycle involving multiplication in animal hosts, epizootic transmission, and fecal re-contamination of water sources. The fact that ambient temperature does not accurately reflect surface water temperature may partly explain the variability of the data. Such an ecological model would also explain the relatively long lag effect of temperature on Campylobacter incidence (up to 6 weeks), as some time would be required for an amplification stage to result in human infection.'),\n",

It should be noted that our study was not aimed at explaining the seasonal pattern of Campylobacter gastroenteritis; such analyses have recently been carried out with inconclusive results. The consistency of the seasonal pattern strongly suggests a role for climatic factors in the epidemiology of Campylobacter, and our results support this. Although several hypotheses for the seasonal peak have been suggested, including seasonal changes in the prevalence of Campylobacter in animals and sewage and changes in human behavior, none of these has been definitively linked to human disease. The numerous risk factors for infection indicate that a number of different factors may be involved. Our findings provide evidence for ambient temperature being one of these factors, probably acting as a more distal, indirect influence driving other intermediate pathways.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe are grateful to Sallyanne Meakins for providing the data on Campylobacter reports and to the British Atmospheric Data Centre for providing access to the Met Office Central England Temperature dataset.

The imbalance between the two peaks is notable and may be associated with the high livestock density in New Zealand. In the summer and autumn, the cryptosporidiosis rate was positively associated with temperatures in the current and previous month, highlighting the importance of outdoor recreation to transmission. No associations between spring incidence and weather were found, providing little support for the importance of drinking-water pathways. Imported travel cases do not appear to be an important factor in the aetiology of cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis is an important cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, and New Zealand has one of the highest reported rates in the world, with between 26.1 and 32.3 new cases per 100,000 population per year. However, not all cases of cryptosporidiosis in the community are reported to national surveillance, and so these numbers are likely to be significant underestimates. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium, and cases have symptoms of gastroenteritis which typically last from several days to several weeks. Our understanding of the causes of cryptosporidiosis has highlighted risks from poorly treated drinking water, swimming in swimming pools, contact with farm animals, and person-to-person transmission as being important.\\n\\nIn many countries, cryptosporidiosis incidence varies from year to year, and climatic variability and community spread from imported travel cases are suggested as important sources of this inter-annual variability. Precipitation may wash Cryptosporidium from the land into rivers or lead to effluents bypassing sewage-treatment works and being discharged directly into surface waters. If these waters are subsequently used for public water supplies, then human cryptosporidiosis may result. Weather may also affect countryside trips and other recreational activities (e.g., swimming pool visits), potentially bringing humans into contact with Cryptosporidium. Imported travel cases may lead to secondary transmission.\\n\\nThis research aimed to improve the understanding of cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand through a detailed analysis of its seasonal patterns and the factors underlying these. The analysis was undertaken at a national level, an approach which has been used in a large number of previous time-series studies. This is the first such study in New Zealand.\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: Dr. I. R. Lake, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.

New Zealand average monthly cryptosporidiosis rate 1997–2005. &nbsp; &mdash; All New Zealand; &nbsp; , North Island; &nbsp; , South Island.\\n\\nThe number of monthly reported cryptosporidiosis cases in New Zealand between 1997 and 2005 were obtained, and any cases reporting recent foreign travel (4.3% of the total cases) were excluded as the infection may have been acquired abroad. It is known that these reported figures represent a small fraction of the total cases in the community but because ascertainment is unlikely to vary by month, the data should provide a representative time-series profile of cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand. Outbreak cases were retained in the analysis. These numbers were divided by an estimate of the New Zealand population each year (obtained from Statistics New Zealand) and the number of days in each month to produce a daily rate for each month.\\n\\nIn order to investigate the seasonality of cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand, monthly graphs of incidence were constructed for the whole of New Zealand. Separate graphs were constructed for the North and South Islands (see Fig. 1).\\n\\nTo account for possible causes of inter-annual variability in cryptosporidiosis incidence, mean monthly temperature was obtained for each month between 1997 and 2005 from the New Zealand National Climate Centre. This average temperature value is based upon temperature observations across New Zealand. Estimates of run-off were obtained using daily discharges for seven major rivers in New Zealand (Mohaka, Hutt, Mangakahia, Clarence, Waimakariri, Pomahaka, and Buller). These were selected because of the continuous nature of the monitoring data, their geographical spread, and their mostly uncontrolled catchments. These data were standardized by average river flow, and averaged to produce one estimate of monthly river flow across New Zealand. Monthly rainfall was obtained for the 10 main urban centres in New Zealand and averaged to produce a single national estimate of monthly rainfall. The number of reported travel-related cryptosporidiosis cases each month was also obtained.\\n\\nThe possible associations between cryptosporidiosis and these explanatory variables were examined using previously published time-series regression methods. These associations may vary at different times of the year. Consequently, the data were analysed by taking each month in turn and using ordinary least-squares regression to examine the relationship between the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate and the temperature, precipitation, river flow, and travel cases in that month. To account for possible lagged relationships, variables were constructed indicating the values for the three previous months, which were then tested in the model. A 3-month period was selected because it is unlikely that a case of...\\n---\\n# Cryptosporidiosis Seasonality in New Zealand\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Cryptosporidiosis Seasonality in New Zealand\\n\\n# Table: Ordinary Least-Squares Regression Model of Monthly Cryptosporidiosis Rate\\n\\n|Variable|Estimate|95% CI|t value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Intercept|0.611***|1.392 to 0.831|3.64|\\n|Cryptosporidiosis rate the previous month|0.0566**|0.0199 to 0.0933|5.12|\\n|Average central New Zealand temperature in the current and previous month (°C)|0| |3|\\n\\n# The model also included 5 presence/absence variables indicating to which month each observation was a member.\\n\\n$ The change in cases in monthly cryptosporidiosis rate per unit change in the explanatory variable.\\n\\nR² = 64.01, *** P < 0.001, ** P < 0.93%.\\n\\nDegrees of freedom = 39.\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis will be affected by events before this period.

The results for the models of interannual variability indicated that between January and May, cryptosporidiosis was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with mean New Zealand temperature in the current and previous month (Table). Similar results were obtained when data for the North and South Islands of New Zealand were analyzed separately. No associations between cryptosporidiosis and the explanatory variables existed at other times of the year.\\n\\nThe discussion of these results will start by focusing upon the seasonal patterns of cryptosporidiosis revealed in the Figure. New Zealand displays two peaks of cryptosporidiosis incidence, one in the spring (September) and another in the autumn (March). This seasonal pattern mirrors that of England and Wales, whereas other countries, such as the United States, do not tend to have a spring peak. However, in New Zealand, the spring peak is three times as large as the autumn peak, whereas in England and Wales, the spring peak is 20% smaller than the autumn peak. This difference is more pronounced in the South Island where the spring peak is nearly five times the magnitude of the autumn peak. The cryptosporidiosis peak in the South Island (October) also occurs one month later than in the North Island (September). This discrepancy is probably due to the increased latitude of the South Island and the consequent delay in the start of the agricultural season (e.g., lambing).\\n\\nThe standard deviation bars indicate that between years, the cryptosporidiosis rate is proportionally most variable during the autumn (March coefficient of variation = 0.9) and less variable in the spring (September coefficient of variation = 0.25).\\n\\nThe spring peak might be proportionally larger in New Zealand than in England and Wales for a number of reasons. In both countries, the spring peak contains a majority of infections with C. parvum indicating direct or indirect contact with the animal reservoir as the cause of infection. In the spring, livestock are most infectious due to the birth of large numbers of new, and hence highly infectious livestock. The New Zealand economy is heavily based on dairy, beef, and sheep farming, providing greater opportunities for direct contact with the animal reservoir of infection than in England and Wales. In New Zealand, the livestock density is 4017 livestock units per 100 population compared to 1630 in the United Kingdom (FAO statistics). This proposition is supported by the observation that the South Island, with a livestock density greater than the North Island, has a proportionally greater cryptosporidiosis spring peak.\\n\\nThe spring peak may appear proportionally larger in New Zealand due to the small magnitude of the autumn peak. In New Zealand, many human samples were C. hominis in the autumn indicating that the source of infection is human in nature. Consequently, incidence may be lower than in England and Wales.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-align: justify;\\n}\\n.acknowledgements, .declaration, .references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder: 1px solid #ccc;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand\\n\\nDue to the low population density in New Zealand providing fewer opportunities for person-to-person transmission of cryptosporidiosis. In England and Wales, the autumn peak is associated with high numbers of imported travel cases and community transmission from these. However, reported travel cases were not significant in any of the autumn regression models suggesting that travel cases are not playing a significant role in the autumn peak in New Zealand.\\n\\nTuring our attention to the time-series regressions, the Table indicates that between January and May cryptosporidiosis was positively and significantly associated with mean New Zealand temperature in the current and previous month. The autumn cryptosporidiosis peak has been linked to increased recreational water use, swimming, outdoor activities and increased person-to-person spread. These activities are usually greater in warmer weather and so the positive associations uncovered between temperature and cryptosporidiosis between January and May suggest the importance of these transmission pathways. The importance of person-to-person transmission is emphasized by the observation that many autumn cases are infected with the *C. hominis* species.\\n\\nBetween June and December there were no associations between cryptosporidiosis and weather in New Zealand. This contrasts with England and Wales where strong relationships between cryptosporidiosis in the spring and measures of run-off (river flow) have been found and linked to the ingress of *Cryptosporidium* into water-courses and drinking-water supplies. It was hypothesized that drinking water would be an important pathway for cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand as in 2005 only 71% of New Zealand’s population were supplied with drinking water complying with protozoan regulations. Consequently, the lack of association between cryptosporidiosis and river flows or rainfall is unexpected.\\n\\nRiver flows will correlate poorly with run-off in New Zealand due to the importance of snow melt to river flows. However, no relationships between cryptosporidiosis and rainfall existed either, although rainfall is also a poor measure of run-off because it will only lead to washing of *Cryptosporidium from the land if the soil is already saturated. One further explanation for the lack of a relationship between river flows or precipitation and cryptosporidiosis could be that, in comparison with England and Wales, New Zealand has a number of geographically distinct climatic areas. Consequently, countrywide measures of rainfall or river flow are less appropriate. This proposition was explored by producing separate models for the two district health authorities in New Zealand, Canterbury and Waikato, with the greatest number of cryptosporidiosis cases. Case numbers were then compared to the rainfall and river flow at the same location. However, neither region displayed any consistent associations with weather during the spring. This implies either that water supply is not important to the aetiology of cryptosporidiosis in the spring or that the risk of Cryptosporidium* ingress into drinking-water supplies is not associated with rainfall and river flow in New Zealand. There is further support for the latter due to the observation that cryptosporidiosis numbers are relatively stable from year to year in the spring. This may be due to structural differences between the water supply in England and Wales and New Zealand. The latter contains large numbers of small local supplies.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe acknowledge the help of Ruth Pirie at ESR in supplying the cryptosporidiosis health surveillance data and for providing helpful advice about the appropriate use of these data.

However, knowledge of the impact of climate variability on cryptosporidiosis is much less certain. Associations between the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and climatic variables have been reported in several countries.\\n\\nGiven that the identified relationships were not consistently reported across studies, it is not known whether these were country-specific observations or can be considered more globally. Variation in the disease risk in both low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries presents new challenges and opportunities to enact responsive changes in research and public health policies.\\n\\nAvailable epidemiological evidence of the influence of weather and climate on cryptosporidiosis is reviewed. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, and most studies showed that the incidence of cryptosporidiosis is highly sensitive to climatic conditions, especially temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. The identified associations varied across studies, with different conditions of importance and lag times across different locations.\\n\\nTherefore, there is a need for countries at risk to assess Cryptosporidium transmission routes based on the spatiotemporal patterns of the disease and what role climate and other socio-ecological changes play in the transmission. Information gathering will then allow us to provide information for evidence-based control strategies and mitigation of transmission.\\n\\nThis review offers new perspectives on the role of climate variability on Cryptosporidium transmission. It highlights different epidemiological approaches adopted and provides the potential for future research and surveillance to reduce the disease burden. By evaluating the epidemiological transmission of this organism in high-income countries, all mitigation strategies, for example filtration and water catchment management, can be used as exemplars of preventing infection in low- to middle-income countries.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nclimate, cryptosporidiosis, public health, waterborne disease, weather\\n\\n# 1.

Worldwide, the monthly average temperature is increasing. This could affect the environment and human health in both temperate and tropical regions.\\n\\n&copy; 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Change\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.impact-list {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\npadding-left: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Impacts of Climate Change on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nStudies in high-income countries have shown that much of the burden of waterborne diseases is attributable to higher frequency and intensity of heatwaves, prolonged precipitation events, increased floods, storms, droughts, and wildfires (Cann et al., 2013; Charron et al., 2004; Funari et al., 2012; Levy et al., 2018; Marcogliese, 2016). Change in climate is expected to increase the risk of waterborne diseases by affecting the biological, chemical, and physical components of water through different pathways (El Baz & Kholoud, 2019). Projected changes such as these will directly affect the exposure pathways of waterborne diseases like cryptosporidiosis through their influence on the reproduction and survival rate of Cryptosporidium spp. Public health practitioners must therefore optimize intervention strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of disease is disproportionately greater.\\n\\n# Overview of Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis is the most common and widespread protozoan waterborne diarrheal infection that has become a global public health challenge. The widely distributed apicomplexan waterborne protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp. that can live in the intestine of humans and animals is responsible for the disease. There are over 30 species of Cryptosporidium, but only two species, Cryptosporidium hominis (specific to only humans) and Cryptosporidium parvum (specific to humans and animals), are thought to be of public health significance (Ramirez et al., 2004). However, sporadic reports of infection with other species can occur (Liu et al., 2020).\\n\\n# Global Burden of Disease\\n\\nThe Global Burden of Disease Study, conducted in 2016, showed that Cryptosporidium caused 57,200 deaths in all age groups, with more than 80% of deaths occurring in children younger than 5 years (Khalil et al., 2018). Unlike other waterborne parasites, infection depends on several factors involving host, pathogen, and environment. The oocysts, which are the infective stage in the parasite's life cycle, pose a severe threat to both human and animal health because they are naturally present in the environment. Previous research showed that oocysts could survive for prolonged periods under a range of environmental pressures (Alum et al., 2014; Atherholt et al., 1998; Chalmers et al., 1997; Robertson et al., 1992; Rose, 1997; Rose et al., 2002; Gorospe, 2005).\\n\\n# Transmission and Symptoms\\n\\nA single oocyst is sufficient to produce infection and disease in susceptible hosts (Ramirez et al., 2004). The time from ingestion to infection is short, taking between 2 and 12 days, with an average of about seven days, which may explain why there is rapid transmission once an outbreak occurs (Hu et al., 2007). Upon excretion in the feces of the host (either animal or human), the oocyst remains infectious and is transmitted principally through the fecal–oral route either from person to person or animal to person (Fayer, 2010; Fayer & Xiao, 2007; Pollock et al., 2010; Xiao, 2010).\\n\\nThe disease is characterized by non-bloody watery diarrhea accompanied by bloating, abdominal pain, dehydration, loss of appetite, nausea, weight loss, fever, and vomiting (Funari et al., 2012; Pollock et al., 2010). It is also associated with long-term health sequelae such as irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthropathy, headache, joint pain, and eye pain (Hunter et al., 2004; Iglói et al., 2018; Stiff et al., 2017). There is currently no effective treatment for or vaccine against cryptosporidiosis (Hu et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2010; Mead, 2014; Bartelt et al., 2016), making prevention the focus of public health interventions.\\n\\n# Risk Factors and Seasonal Patterns\\n\\nThe disease distribution is generally expressed in terms of incidence (new cases per year) and prevalence (total number of existing and new cases at a specified time or during a specified period). Several risk factors that influence the spatial and temporal patterns of cryptosporidiosis have been identified. Examples include drinking water from poorly treated public and private supplies, visiting/living on a farm, and contact with farm animals and wild animals. Other factors include swimming in contaminated swimming pools, travel to endemic regions, eating contaminated food, agricultural practices, and contact with young children, especially in day-care centers (Hunter & Thompson, 2005; Learmonth et al., 2004; Meinhardt et al., 1996; Putignani & Menichella, 2010; Strachan et al., 2003).\\n\\nIn addition to these, land use/land cover type, weather patterns, and seasonality are identified as risk factors that influence the intensity of contact between Cryptosporidium and susceptible hosts (Hu et al., 2007; Jagai et al., 2012; Lake et al., 2005; Lake et al., 2007; Lake et al., 2008; Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Lal et al., 2012; Lal, Baker, et al., 2013; Lal, Ikeda, et al., 2013; Naumova et al., 2005).

Introduction\\n\\nThe seasonality of cryptosporidiosis cases is influenced by various factors, although the mechanisms by which these factors affect the spread of Cryptosporidium are not fully understood. Accumulated evidence indicates that changes in weather and climatic factors can significantly influence the distribution and transmission of Cryptosporidium. This paper reviews epidemiological studies on the direct and indirect evidence of the influence of weather and climate on cryptosporidiosis. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive update of worldwide published reports of the associations. Knowledge of this is vital, as it would guide mitigation strategies to alleviate and prevent the spread of the disease effectively.\\n\\n# 2. Literature Review\\n\\n# 2.1 Evidence of Seasonality of Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nStudies in high-income countries have reported a bimodal seasonal pattern with some differences. Some authors have reported spring and autumn peaks in England (Lake et al., 2005; Naumova et al., 2005), New Zealand (Lake et al., 2008; Lal et al., 2012; Snel et al., 2009; Lal, Baker, et al., 2013), Scotland (Ramsay et al., 2014), and the United States (Jagai et al., 2009, 2012). However, Callaghan et al. (2009) reported spring and summer peaks in Ireland. In England and Scotland, spring and late summer–early autumn peaks have also been recognized (McLauchlin et al., 2000; Pollock et al., 2010; Strachan et al., 2003). Other studies have reported summer and autumn peaks in Australia (Hu et al., 2007), Canada (Majowicz et al., 2001), and the United States (Naumova, 2000).\\n\\nCommunity-based studies in low- and middle-income countries have reported higher Cryptosporidium infection during rainy seasons in Brazil (Newman et al., 1999; Pereira et al., 2002), Gambia (Adegbola et al., 1994; Hossain et al., 2019), Guinea-Bissau (Perch et al., 2001), India (Das et al., 2006), Madagascar (Areeshi et al., 2008), and the dry season in Kenya (Gatei et al., 2006). The tendency for cases to exhibit seasonal peaks highlights the potential influence of environmental conditions in the spread of the disease. Environmental conditions modulate the replication of Cryptosporidium without the need for host cells. Therefore, the timing of the onset and peak of seasonal transmission, as well as the duration of the transmission season, may depend on annual variability in climatic variables.\\n\\nClimate variability can affect the seasonal pattern of cryptosporidiosis through its influence on local weather conditions (Lake et al., 2005; Lal et al., 2012). Understanding the principal factors controlling the seasonal pattern is essential to comprehend the effect of climate variability on the disease. However, only a few studies have investigated the association between weather and climate with cryptosporidiosis (Hu et al., 2007; Naumova et al., 2005; Lal, Baker, et al., 2013). Seasonal variation in temperature and rainfall may directly or indirectly impact the oocysts. The direct impact supports the survival and dissemination of oocysts in the environment, increasing the probability of contact with susceptible hosts. The indirect impact may influence human behavior through recreational activities, consumption habits, or adaptation behaviors (Semenza et al., 2012).\\n\\n# 2.2 Evidence of Climatic Factors on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nStudies have shown that factors such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity affect the life cycle of Cryptosporidium and can potentially affect the timing and intensity of disease outbreaks (Patz et al., 2000). Several studies have shown an association between weather and climate and cryptosporidiosis incidence (Britton et al., 2010; Curriero et al., 2001; Eze et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2007, 2010; Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Kent et al., 2015; Lake et al., 2005, 2008; Lal et al., 2013; Naumova et al., 2005, 2007). Some have focused on disease outbreaks (Nichols et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2006).\\n\\nStatistical models, such as time-series regression models, have been developed to estimate the effect of climate parameters and explain potential transmission mechanisms. Evidence of the association comes from various high-income countries, including Australia (Hu, Mengersen, Fu, et al., 2010; Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Hu et al., 2007; Kent et al., 2015), Canada (Thomas et al., 2006), England and Wales (Lake et al., 2005; Naumova et al., 2005; Nichols et al., 2009), New Zealand (Britton et al., 2010; Lake et al., 2008; Lal, Ikeda, et al., 2013), Scotland (Eze et al., 2014), and the United States (Curriero et al., 2001; Naumova et al., 2007).\\n\\nHowever, such studies are lacking in low- and middle-income countries where the risk might be higher despite available evidence on the association. No prior published studies report the association between climate variability and cryptosporidiosis incidence. The comprehensive analysis of the association reveals a significant research gap between low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Moreover, findings from high-income countries cannot merely be applied to low- and middle-income countries to identify periods at greater risk of exposure.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Change\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Impact of Climate Change on Cryptosporidiosis Incidence\\n\\nKnowledge of the association between climate change and cryptosporidiosis is vital.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that although there will be a difference in the extent and direction of the effects, average global temperatures will increase between 1.8°C and 4°C.\\n\\nFurthermore, extreme weather events, as well as shifting patterns of the disease, will have significant effects on global disease burden, water and food security, and social conflict over the next century (Solomon et al., 2007). Temperature, rainfall, and humidity are especially important. However, others such as run-off, wind speed, diurnal temperature range, and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can be significant in the disease transmission process. In general, temperature and rainfall are strong modifiers of cryptosporidiosis transmission, as they play a crucial role in the survival and distribution of the oocysts in the environment.\\n\\nComplicating any assessment of cryptosporidiosis incidence in many countries is the lack of record and systematic surveillance. Research on this zoonosis (transmissible from animals to humans) has been neglected in many low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries. In the case of the impacts of climate change and climate variability, this situation is even more critical.\\n\\nOnly a few data are currently available to understand and support such associations. Therefore, more research on the relationship between epidemiological variables, from humans and animals, as well as ecological, environmental, and climatic factors, is needed and justified for cryptosporidiosis. From an environmental point of view, it is essential to understand that other species of Cryptosporidium, hosted by different animal reservoirs, can also cause cryptosporidiosis in humans, for example, immunocompromised individuals and children under five years (Abubakar et al., 2007).\\n\\nThe risk factors and routes of transmission for infection are not well defined in low- and middle-income countries. The complex biological, social, and environmental transmission pathways, associated with a host of human activities, often accelerate and amplify the natural phenomena that modify waterborne disease patterns like cryptosporidiosis in humans. This process poses unprecedented challenges to global public health. It requires further investigation to determine potential risk factors of cryptosporidiosis to prevent this disease transmission and formulate sound public health policy decisions to evaluate adaptation and mitigation measures.\\n\\nThese measures may include enhanced public awareness through public health education and prevention strategies, planning of risk reduction and communication, and promoted integrated disease surveillance, vaccination programmes, information sharing, investment into protective technologies, weather forecasting and early warning systems, emergency management, and disaster preparedness. Awareness and evaluation of the associated factors can aid our understanding of how broader socio-environmental interactions may mediate cryptosporidiosis spread and account for disparities in the disease risk. In turn, this can also contribute to the development of practical, evidence-based climate-responsive management strategies under different weather conditions at the local or regional level.\\n\\nClimate change and variability is a multi-factorial issue. It is vital to note that understanding and managing the impact of climate on disease incidence is a global challenge. A positive association between the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis and rainfall was reported in a global meta-analysis study (Jagai et al., 2009). In a recent Canadian study, extreme precipitation led to a significant increase in cryptosporidiosis after prolonged dry periods (Chhetri et al., 2017). Dry periods could lead to the build-up of oocysts on land, and in combination with more extreme precipitation after these dry periods, higher levels than usual of the oocysts could be transported with run-off to source waters (King & Monis, 2007; Lake et al., 2005).\\n\\nThe impact of global climate change and variability on cryptosporidiosis is likely to affect global, regional, and local health. Therefore, further investigation of the influence of weather and climate is necessary.\\n\\nMoreover, because of the substantial burden of disease along with growing concerns about climate change in low- and middle-income countries, it is of utmost relevance to incorporate climate variability studies into public health control and prevention interventions. Such a practice can provide important information about the disease trend and associated risk factors. Therefore, formulating public health policies to plan and implement preventive measures effectively is crucial (Eisenberg et al., 2002; Robertson et al., 2013).\\n\\n# 3.

All the research was conducted in high-income countries.

Six of the articles provided effect estimates at the national level (Curriero et al., 2001; Lake et al., 2005, 2008; Lal, Ikeda, et al., 2013; Nichols et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2006). Five studies were at the state level (Hu, Mengersen, Fu, et al., 2010; Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Hu et al., 2007; Kent et al., 2015; Naumova et al., 2007), one at regional level (Naumova et al., 2005), one at both national and district levels (Britton et al., 2010) and one at health board level (Eze et al., 2014). All articles were published between 2001 and 2015.\\n---\\n# Association between Weather and Climate and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 40px;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Association between Weather and Climate and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nThe results from the statistical models in the literature provide empirical evidence that climatic variables such as temperature (e.g. mean, maximum and minimum temperatures) and precipitation (e.g. rainfall) are significantly associated with an increased odds of cryptosporidiosis incidence. Table 1 shows a summary of the results of the reviewed studies. Although there is controversy in the association in the literature, there is evidence that cryptosporidiosis transmission is to some extent driven by climate variability. Long-term data sets and several statistical models were adopted to quantify the association between climatic variables and cryptosporidiosis at different levels. The results from the statistical models also confirm visible seasonal patterns in the association between the identified climatic variables and cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\n# Temperature and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nA statistically significant relationship was found between monthly mean temperature and the incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis in England and Wales (Lake et al., 2005). In New Zealand, monthly mean temperature was associated with cryptosporidiosis (Lake et al., 2008); similarly, Lal, Ikeda, et al. (2013) reported an association at a time lag of 1–2 months. In contrast, Britton et al. (2010) did not find an association between temperature and cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand. There is also evidence in the pattern of association between maximum temperature and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. A statistically significant relationship between daily maximum temperature and cryptosporidiosis cases has been shown in Massachusetts, United States (Naumova et al., 2007). Cryptosporidiosis increased about six weeks after ambient temperature reached its annual maximum. Researchers in Australia have also reported similar findings in different studies. Hu, Mengersen, Fu, et al. (2010) found a statistically significant relationship between maximum temperature and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis at a lag of up to eight weeks. Hu et al. (2007) found a significant association between maximum temperature and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis at a lag of up to 3 months in Brisbane. Their result suggests that weather variability (particularly maximum temperature) plays a significant role in the transmission of cryptosporidiosis. It can be either directly or through other unmeasured variables. In another study, Hu, Mengersen, and Tong (2010) also found a significant relationship between monthly maximum temperature and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Queensland. A similar association was found with the number of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in Canada (Thomas et al., 2006). The result revealed that for each degree-day unit increase in total maximum temperature, the relative odds of an outbreak increased by a factor of 1.007 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.002–1.012).\\n\\n# Minimum Temperature and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nFurthermore, in the State of Victoria in Australia, Kent et al. (2015) found that monthly minimum temperature was related to notifications of cryptosporidiosis. In the metropolitan area, a 1°C increase in monthly average minimum temperature of the current month was associated with a 22% increase in cryptosporidiosis notifications (incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.31). In the rural area, a 1°C increase in monthly average minimum temperature, lagged by three months, was associated with a 9% decrease in cryptosporidiosis notifications (IRR 0.91; 95% CI 0.86–0.97). In Scotland, average levels of non-viral gastrointestinal infections, including cryptosporidiosis, increased as temperature and relative humidity increased. In the same study, at the ecological level, increasing levels of faecal indicator organisms in bathing waters were also associated with an increase in the average number of non-viral gastrointestinal infections (Eze et al., 2014).\\n\\n# Precipitation and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nChanges in precipitation were also related to a higher incidence of cryptosporidiosis. A statistically significant relationship between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis rates was found in the North West region of England (Naumova et al., 2005). The study revealed that there would be a 27% (95% CI 21%–33%) increase in the overall weekly rate of cryptosporidiosis in the region if the cumulative rainfall for the prior week was at its 75th percentile or 22 mm. The findings suggest that different environmental processes may underlie the temporal and spatial variations in microbial contamination of drinking water supply. The large spring peak observed may be related to lambing and calving that occurs in the late spring near the region's water supplies.\"),\n",

The large spring peak observed may be related to lambing and calving that occurs in the late spring near the region's water supplies.\\n\\nIn contrast, the autumn peak is thought to be primarily due to infections in people returning from foreign travels. Similarly, there was a positive association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand, and the effect of rainfall was modified by the quality of the domestic water supply (Britton et al., 2010). In contrast, Lake et al. (2005) did not find a positive relationship between rainfall and the incidence rates of cryptosporidiosis; however, a statistically significant positive relationship was found with river flow in England and Wales. Similarly, Hu et al. (2007) and Kent et al. (2015) did not find any association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis in Australia, respectively. Heavy rainfall has also been associated with outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in Canada (Thomas et al., 2006), England and Wales (Nichols et al., 2009) and the United States (Curriero et al., 2001), respectively. Curriero et al. (2001) revealed that heavy rainfall associated with surface water contamination increased cryptosporidiosis outbreak at a lag of 2 months in the United States. In England and Wales, Nichols et al. (2009) showed that heavy rainfall increased cryptosporidiosis cases (up by 40%) during the week preceding the outbreak and up to four weeks preceding the outbreaks, even when the rain had stopped. In Canada, for rainfall events higher than the 93rd percentile there was a greater than twofold increase in the odds of an outbreak compared with rainfall events less than the 93rd percentile (Thomas et al., 2006). The literature also highlighted the significance of relative humidity and wind speed in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. While there was a statistically significant relationship between relative humidity and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis at a lag of up to one week (Hu, Mengersen, Fu, et al., 2010) and a lag of one month (Hu et al., 2007), a statistically significant...\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Variables\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3, h4 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 40px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-align: justify;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Variables\\n\\n# 5. Discussion\\n\\nPrevious studies have shown that weather and climate exert a critical influence on the spatial and temporal range of cryptosporidiosis, and several notable points were concluded from the literature. Most importantly, the results suggest that climate variability (temperature and rainfall) may have played a significant role in the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. Also, the transmission could be either through a direct effect or other unmeasured variables. Although the findings across countries showed mixed outcomes for temperature and rainfall, that is the association was either positive or negative, in general, these variables were more often associated with increased risk of cryptosporidiosis. It is important to note that several factors could have influenced the study findings, and inter-country comparison is related to many issues including bias, laboratory ascertainment, and depth of environmental investigation.\\n\\nFurthermore, several factors could have influenced the study findings. The transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. is a complex process with multiple hosts and routes and varies widely within and across countries. Evidence for this is that the micro-epidemiological variation of Cryptosporidium oocysts is related to fine-scale heterogeneity in biological, environmental, genetic, social, and other contextual factors (Al Mawly et al., 2015; Shrivastava et al., 2017). However, the literature does not imply a single main transmission route that would explain the observed association. Variability in the association between the climatic factors and cryptosporidiosis may also be explained, in part, by differences in pathogen distribution and regional climate patterns. Therefore, different interaction processes may underlie the temporal and spatial variations in Cryptosporidium transmission. Also, the seasonal effect of temperature and rainfall may explain some differences in the variation of cryptosporidiosis incidence within studies and between countries.\\n\\nThe peaks in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis fluctuate with the seasons and are usually associated with warm and moist weather. It is suggested that in England, the spring peaks in cryptosporidiosis incidence may be related to contaminated water supplies as a result of heavy rainfall events (Naumova et al., 2005). Moreover, increased seasonal oocysts load following livestock shedding coupled with heavy rainfall could result in seasonally high cryptosporidiosis rates (Lake et al., 2005). Besides, high rainfall may facilitate oocyst run-off, contaminating surface and drinking water sources (Gertler et al., 2015; Lal et al., 2012). Although increased run-off is an inevitable consequence of increased rainfall, increased run-off may also follow extended dry periods which may lead to a higher oocysts load, resulting in increased disease (Lal, 2016). During the cool and warm conditions of spring, when the oocysts remain viable, people become more frequently engaged in several outdoor activities. The spring peak observed in England and Wales, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States could be related to seasonal agricultural activities such as calving, lambing, and farm visits (especially during Easter holidays) (Eze et al., 2014; Lake et al., 2005, 2008; McGuigan et al., 2010; Naumova et al., 2005; Nichols et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2006). Besides, seasonal patterns of high oocysts shedding into the environment generally increase during spring months, and this can lead to a significant increase in human infections (Strachan et al., 2003; Lake et al., 2007; Pollock et al., 2010; Lal, Ikeda, et al., 2013).\\n\\nAlthough rainfall plays a role in cryptosporidiosis incidence, temperature affects transmission in several ways. The studies emphasized that as a result of changing climate, temperature is likely to increase cryptosporidiosis incidence (Eze et al., 2014; Hu, Mengersen, Fu, et al., 2010; Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Hu et al., 2007; Kent et al., 2015; Lake et al., 2005, 2008; Lal, Ikeda, et al., 2013; Naumova et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2006). A possible underlying mechanism for the positive association between temperature and cryptosporidiosis is that temperature may have increased the viability of the oocysts and increased the rate of the disease transmission in different regions (King & Monis, 2007). For example, milder winter temperatures may favour some transmission routes, as well as enhance the survival and viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the environment, change human activities, and increase the rate of the disease transmission in different regions. The study by King and Monis (2007) indicated that Cryptosporidium oocysts could maintain high levels of infectivity for periods of at least 24 weeks at temperatures between 1 and 15°C. In water, the persistence of oocysts was not affected by temperatures 40°C. Warmer temperatures may also have increased the survival of oocysts in soil subsurface freezing, or lake ice covers prone areas. In turn, this results in significant numbers of oocysts remaining infective after the winter period (King & Monis, 2007).\\n\\nMoreover, warm temperatures often bring about changes in human activities such as greater use of swimming pools and beaches, increased outdoor activities, demand for water, and less conscientious hygienic practice which influence Cryptosporidium transmission rates (Hu, Mengersen, & Tong, 2010; Onozuka et al., 2010). Also, C. parvum thrives in warm waters of moderate salinity and has a close association with aquatic invertebrates (Hu et al., 2007). Therefore, based on results in the literature and the findings in this study, it can be suggested that temperature and rainfall are significant in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. However, the association may vary among and within different regions.\"),\n",

However, the association may vary among and within different regions.\\n\\nGiven the variability of these factors across countries and the different characteristics of the data sources used in the analysed studies, it is challenging to synthesize further the results, and the range of statistical techniques and methods employed does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions. However, the findings confirm that there is a direct and indirect relationship between climatic variables and cryptosporidiosis transmission. Therefore, to draw definitive conclusions, we must rely on the precision of the estimates. Doing this allows epidemiologists and public health practitioners to offer useful recommendations for policymakers to plan and coordinate strategic public health prevention actions adequately. Therefore, a key suggestion from the literature review is the adoption of cross-disciplinary research explicitly designed to address the complexities of this issue.\\n---\\n# Strategic Analysis of Climate-Infection Hypotheses\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Strategic Analysis of Climate-Infection Hypotheses\\n\\nThere is a substantial body of evidence that regular short-term climate variability will continue to cause problems for water and water-related health effects (Phung et al., 2015). Thus, our changing climate based on warmer temperatures and increasingly variable rainfall patterns can increase oocysts abundance and distribution in the environment, based on the assumption that climate acts as an essential factor in determining the levels of other risk factors to influence the likelihood of oocysts ending up in the environment and increasing cryptosporidiosis infection, for example, animal husbandry involving cattle and possibly goats and sheep, wildlife, improper disposal of manure, sewage sludge or wastewater, leaking septic tanks, cesspools, sewers or landfills, failure of water treatment systems, inadequate attention to sanitation in wells, poor maintenance and treatment practices (Collinet-Adler & Ward, 2010; Daniels et al., 2016; Hrudey, 2004; Miller et al., 2008; Pedley & Howard, 1997; Rizak & Hrudey, 2008; Robertson, 2009; Rose, 1997; Schuster et al., 2005; Young et al., 2015; Zahedi et al., 2016).\\n\\nAdditionally, periods of heavy rainfall can result in re-mobilization and redistribution of oocysts in sewage/wastewater into the environment. Consequently, it remains a significant independent risk factor that should be examined with the incidence of cryptosporidiosis. Assuming that the predicted climate change occurs, it is suggested that rising temperatures might boost the number of cryptosporidiosis cases. Based on the fact that higher summer temperatures may allow the growth of Cryptosporidium oocysts, more extreme precipitation events might increase oocyst survival through the saturation of soil profiles and mobilization of the oocysts more often (King & Monis, 2007), thus, significantly increasing the risk of contamination in drinking water and the transmission of Cryptosporidium.\\n\\nAlthough the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it is imperative to note that several other factors such as socio-economic factors and changes in land use are equally significant. These factors add to the difficulty in identifying the nature of the association of climate and predicting exactly how much the change in climate might impact the disease incidence.\\n\\nMoreover, the impact of climate variability at temporal and spatial scales is predicted to be worse in low- and middle-income countries where challenging socio-economic and political contexts exacerbate lack of epidemiological studies on the disease incidence (Hlahla & Hill, 2018; Olsson et al., 2014). Because of the anticipated increase in the cryptosporidiosis incidence as a result of climate variability, further research to characterize how the impact of changing temperature and rainfall patterns on the disease is necessary. This approach could improve our ability to identify high-risk populations and public health decision-making. The use of mechanistic models that combine epidemiological, experimental, and environmental data can also be used to evaluate the climate-attributable risk of cryptosporidiosis and can provide information valuable for the decision-making process (Eisenberg et al., 2002).\\n\\nBesides, examining the determinants of cryptosporidiosis should include interventions, environmental factors, and socio-demographics. Evidence of these would allow a better understanding of the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis and identification of significant predictors to consider for the disease forecasting. Several environmental and population settings should also be examined to improve the understanding of contextual contributions to cryptosporidiosis risk. Environmental variables that are the most related or the most consistently related to cryptosporidiosis risk should be systematically used in future studies assessing the effects of weather and climate. Doing this will allow for the pooling of data across studies and provide a better understanding of the disease transmission process. Further studies should also include clear categorization and description of variables, considerations of timescale, units of measurement, and lagged effects. Moreover, the One Health Initiative that emphasizes the interdependency between human, animal, and environmental health and the significance of interdisciplinary effort could provide a pragmatic coordinated and collaborative approach to attaining optimal prevention and risk management opportunity to be implemented across countries (Kahn, 2011; Karesh et al., 2012; Rabinowitz et al., 2013).\\n\\nThe limitation of this review is acknowledged. There is evidence of reporting and publication bias. These studies have used secondary data which may have resulted in under-reporting of cryptosporidiosis cases. However, the use of long-term data sets and study designs bolsters confidence in the significant findings revealed in these studies. Moreover, the inclusion of multiple terminologies in the database searches and detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria used in this study aimed to mitigate against publication bias. This review offers a step towards understanding the influence of climate variability on cryptosporidiosis. Several environmental factors and host factors (animal and human) all influence Cryptosporidium populations, as well as the degree of contact between human beings and this pathogen. An epidemiological investigation using retrospective data offers insights into the pathways of disease transmission. This concept provides an understanding of the impact of climate on the disease incidence, which is significant for decision-making and resource allocation for disease control and prevention.\\n\\n# Conclusion and Recommendations\\n\\nAlthough there is significant debate on the link between weather and climate and cryptosporidiosis occurrence, this review summarizes the evidence of the association. The findings in these studies demonstrate the significant role of weather and climate in the transmission of cryptosporidiosis. There seems to be an increasing incidence of cryptosporidiosis, and it is plausible that the changing pattern of climate will lead to a significant increase in the number of cases. While an increase has been reported in Ireland (HSE, 2018), a decrease has been reported in Scotland (HPS, 2018) showing the difficulty of confirming an association between countries. It is therefore essential to note that the relative contribution of each climatic parameter appears to vary between the regions and countries and is determinant on the prevailing conditions.\\n---\\n# Ecological Determinants of Cryptosporidium Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\nul {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\npadding-left: 20px;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .conflict-of-interest, .authors-contribution, .ethical-statement {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Ecological Determinants of Cryptosporidium Transmission\\n\\nAs an emerging global zoonosis that is still neglected and poorly understood, further investigation in the context of a changing environment is needed, particularly in high-risk countries.

This review has highlighted the need for further epidemiologic research and long-term surveillance in both low- and middle-income countries and high-income countries.\\n\\nMoreover, the evidence of association in one country is not sufficient to evaluate the influence of variation in weather and climate on cryptosporidiosis incidence in other countries. As climate change threatens to increase global temperature and intensify the frequency of rain and extreme weather events, there might be a significant increase in the disease incidence and in the frequency and duration of outbreaks. Therefore, predicting what may happen in the future can help countries make sure they are prepared and target public health interventions effectively.\\n\\nAlthough it may be challenging to determine what approach works well in terms of cryptosporidiosis prevention, the researchers make the following recommendations on managing the potential impact of weather and climate on the disease transmission:\\n\\n- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance through regular recording historical information on disease incidence and related factors.\\n- Develop improved models that incorporate the several drivers associated with the disease incidence (such as climate and land use) to assess the risks posed by climatic and ecological changes.\\n- The need for further research on the link between climate and cryptosporidiosis at different temporal and spatial scales to improve understanding of the effect of climate change and develop effective public health interventions to deal with changing disease patterns.\\n- Collaboration with environmental organizations to develop management plans to prepare effectively during outbreaks resulting from extreme events (such as flooding and drought).\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors acknowledge the contribution of the reviewers whose constructive criticism was of guidance in the revision of this review.\\n\\n# Conflict of Interest\\n\\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\\n\\n# Authors' Contribution\\n\\nBoth authors contributed equally to this review and approved the version to be published.\\n\\n# Ethical Statement\\n\\nThis review does not contain any studies involving human participants performed by any of the authors.\\n\\n# ORCID\\n\\nIsotein Adalia Ikiroma: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-1586\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAbubakar, I., Aliyu, S.

Environmental pathways have, therefore, largely been ignored. Rotavirus, however, persists in water sources, and both its surface water concentrations and infection incidence vary with temperature. Here, we examine the potential for waterborne rotavirus transmission. We use a mechanistic model that incorporates both direct and waterborne transmission pathways, coupled with a hydrological model, and we simulate rotavirus transmission between two communities with interconnected water sources.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nTo parameterize temperature dependency, we estimated temperature-dependent decay rates in water through a meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis suggests that rotavirus decay rates are positively associated with temperature (n = 39, P < 0.001). This association is stronger at higher temperatures (over 20°C), consistent with tropical climate conditions. Our model analysis demonstrates that water could disseminate rotavirus between the two communities for all modeled temperatures.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nWhile direct transmission was important for disease amplification within communities, waterborne transmission could also amplify transmission. In standing-water systems, the modeled increase in decay led to decreased disease, with every 1°C increase in temperature leading to up to a 2.4% decrease in incidence. These effect sizes are consistent with prior meta-analyses, suggesting that environmental transmission through water sources may partially explain the observed associations between temperature and rotavirus incidence.\\n\\n# Significance\\n\\nAlthough rotavirus persists in water and its incidence varies with temperature, the potential role of waterborne transmission in explaining the observed seasonal pattern in low-income countries in the tropics has thus far been neglected. Our analysis suggests that water can affect incidence for larger communities that draw water from slow-moving or stagnant sources and is likely most important in cooler seasons. Water can also spread outbreaks between communities, even when environmental transmission cannot sustain outbreaks.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOur model may help explain temperature–incidence associations found in prior meta-analyses in the tropics, where humidity is high year-round, and shows that the effect of temperature on risk depends on local hydrologic conditions. These findings help explain why the effect of temperature might be context-specific.\\n\\nAuthor contributions: A.N.M.K., A.F.B., and J.N.S.E. designed research; A.N.M.K., A.F.B., N.L., and P.A.C. performed research; A.N.M.K. and N.L. analyzed data; and A.N.M.K., A.F.B., N.L., P.A.C., J.V.R., and J.N.S.E. wrote the paper.

In general, the burden of diarrheal disease is expected to increase as climate change progresses; however, there is a great deal of heterogeneity by pathogen.\\n\\nFor bacterial pathogens, increased temperature is related to decreased persistence but can also lead to expression of genes associated with increased virulence. The net effect of increased temperature is thus expected to increase risk. In contrast, higher temperatures are expected to decrease only environmental persistence of viruses, including rotavirus, and thus are expected to reduce viral infection risks.\\n\\n# Modeling Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nIn this study, we use a mechanistic model of rotavirus transmission to evaluate the potential of rotavirus to be transmitted through the environment. The basic reproduction number can be written as a sum of two submodel reproduction numbers:\\n\\nR0 = R0,H + R0,W\\n\\nIn this expression, R0,H is the reproduction number from human-to-human transmission, and R0,W is the reproduction number for water-to-human transmission. The parameters involved include:\\n\\n- βH: transmission rate for direct, human-to-human transmission\\n- γ: recovery rate\\n- βW: transmission rate from water\\n- N: population size\\n- φ: shedding rate for infected individuals\\n- ρ: water consumed per day\\n- (1 − c): fraction of shed pathogens that mix in the local water supply\\n- μ: temperature-dependent rotavirus decay rate in water sources\\n- ν: river flow velocity\\n\\n# Meta-Analysis: Temperature and Die-Off\\n\\nOur literature search returned 57 articles. Of these, we identified 9 that met our inclusion criteria containing a total of 39 experiments for use in our analysis.

Although our meta-analysis indicated that higher temperatures were associated with faster decay of rotavirus, our model predicts that this effect would not be sufficient to prevent dissemination through water sources in areas similar to our study site in Ecuador.\\n\\nIn communities with standing-water sources, water acted as an amplifier of local transmission. The sensitivity of our model to per capita water availability suggests that larger cities with poor sanitation infrastructure, where most residents rely on a single reservoir for drinking water, may be especially vulnerable to waterborne transmission. In contrast, for communities using standing-water sources, the effect of temperature was more pronounced, leading to smaller outbreaks due to decreased persistence of rotavirus in the water supply.\\n\\n# Dissemination of Rotavirus Through Flowing Waterways\\n\\nTogether, our results indicate that water is likely a sufficient disseminator of infection in most flowing systems. It is not necessary for the overall reproduction number in the upstream community to exceed 1 for dissemination to occur. In most contexts, the sufficient condition (R0 > 1) is likely to be met either through direct transmission alone (R0,H > 1) or through indirect transmission if contamination levels are high due to low water volumes (R0,W > 1).\\n\\nThe overall reproduction number is a function of both direct and indirect transmission, making it sufficient for the sum of both submodel R0s to exceed 1. The submodel reproduction number R0,H is likely to be greater than 1 in most contexts without focused interventions targeting this pathway, due to the high shedding rate of rotavirus relative to its median infectious dose and its persistence on various environmental surfaces.\\n\\n# Multiple Pathways: Direct and Indirect Transmission\\n\\nWhile some seasonality patterns in rotavirus incidence may be partially explained by dynamic resonance related to birth rates, many other factors, including environmental variables like temperature, may also contribute to this seasonal risk pattern. Our analysis identified situations where indirect transmission can significantly affect disease spread through watersheds and may be sufficient to cause large outbreaks.\\n\\nWhen both environmental and direct transmission causes are met in a population, conventional epidemiologic studies analyzing case data alone may not detect environmental transmission due to multiple mechanisms explaining the observed dynamics. By considering this environmental route, we explored the potential importance of both pathways. Our model indicates that while direct human-to-human transmission is crucial for local amplification, indirect transmission may sustain and spread outbreaks.\\n\\n# Implications for Trends in Rotavirus Risk Under Climate Change\\n\\nAs global temperatures are projected to rise due to climate change, understanding the relationship between temperature and disease risk becomes essential. Our model suggests that the observed decrease in rotavirus infections at higher temperatures may be attributed to increased die-off of rotavirus in water sources. However, other pathogens may exhibit different temperature responses, with some studies indicating a slight elevation in the risk of bacterial and protozoan diarrhea at higher temperatures.\\n\\nFuture research combining environmental sampling with case data will be crucial to validate our conclusions and clarify the relative importance of different transmission routes.\\n\\nReferences: (14–18), (8, 9, 35), (2, 6, 37, 38), (39), (40)\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Transmission and Temperature Effects\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.conclusion, .methods {\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\npadding: 15px;\\nborder-left: 5px solid #3498db;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Transmission and Temperature Effects\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn recent studies, temperature-activated virulence genes in various bacterial species have been identified, indicating an increased risk of disease at higher temperatures, even amidst faster die-off rates. Some bacteria exhibit higher replication rates at elevated temperatures, suggesting a potential shift in the etiology of waterborne diarrhea cases from rotavirus to bacterial and protozoal infections as global temperatures rise.\\n\\n# Model Overview\\n\\nOur model represents two hydrologically connected communities at either end of a 10-km river reach. SIR individuals in community i are categorized into compartments S (susceptible), I (infectious), and R (recovered). Transmission can occur directly through contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals or indirectly through ingestion of pathogens in the aqueous environment.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nWhile waterborne transmission of rotavirus is acknowledged, its significance is often underestimated compared to direct transmission. Our analysis confirms that direct transmission plays a crucial role in amplifying rotavirus infections within communities. The findings emphasize the necessity of considering waterborne pathways in rotavirus control interventions, particularly in tropical regions where virus accumulation in waterways may be more pronounced.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nWe developed an ordinary differential equation (ODE) transmission model to examine the role of temperature on rotavirus transmission patterns. A meta-analysis of studies on rotavirus die-off rates in water was conducted to parameterize the model and assess temperature effects. The model utilized a mixing-cell hydrological transport approach to simulate pathogen movement between upstream and downstream communities.\\n\\n# Conceptual Framework of the Analysis\\n\\nFigure 6.

In order to identify temporal patterns in the prevalence of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in a voluntary monitoring programme in broiler flocks in Germany and in the reported human incidence, time series methods were used. The data originated between May 2004 and June 2007. By the use of seasonal decomposition, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions, it could be shown that an annual seasonality is present. However, the peak month differs between sample submission, prevalence in broilers and human incidence. Strikingly, the peak in human campylobacterioses preceded the peak in broiler prevalence in Lower Saxony rather than occurring after it. Significant cross-correlations between monthly temperature and prevalence in broilers as well as between human incidence, monthly temperature, rainfall and wind-force were identified. The results highlight the necessity to quantify the transmission of Campylobacter from broiler to humans and to include climatic factors in order to gain further insight into the epidemiology of this zoonotic disease.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter, a major zoonotic pathogen, is the most commonly reported, food-borne bacterial cause of human enteritis in Europe (Anonymous, 2006). Poultry meat is consistently considered to be the most important risk factor for human campylobacteriosis, and the reduction in the number of poultry products contaminated with Campylobacter is suggested as a means to improve public health (Rosenquist et al., 2003; Wagenaar et al., 2006). Numerous studies based on questionnaires, cross-sectional or case–control studies have investigated the epidemiology of Campylobacter spp. and potential risk factors in poultry flocks. Most of these studies have focussed on static risk assessment models without taking into account the fact that some factors might influence the occurrence of Campylobacter through seasonal or other time-dependent patterns. The spread of Campylobacter within the flock is rapid (Berndtson et al., 1996; Evans and Sayers, 2000) and virtually all animals will be colonized with this commensal within 6 days after introduction of the agent (Van Gerwe et al., 2005).\\n\\n© 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Verlag • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 117–128\\n---\\n# Campylobacter Monitoring\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Campylobacter Monitoring\\n\\nS. Hartnack et al.\\n\\nHowever, several questions about the dynamics of the colonization process and the transmission routes remain unanswered (Rivoal et al., 2005; Conlan et al., 2007). Campylobacter are fragile organisms, susceptible to a number of environmental conditions (temperature, presence of oxygen, pH, UV, humidity) but may survive in a viable but non-cultivable form (VBNC) in the environment (Talibart et al., 2000). In water samples from a broiler farm with chickens colonized with Campylobacter, the agent itself was not detected by different culture methods, but evidence for its presence in 60% of 167 samples was given by an indirect fluorescence antibody test (Pearson et al., 1993). The VBNC state leads to uncertainty in the interpretation of observational studies of the disease ecology because false negative test results may occur if Campylobacter is only present in its VBNC state (Skelly and Weinstein, 2003). The potential role of the VBNC state in broiler prevalence and in human campylobacteriosis is controversially discussed (Oliver, 2005; Murphy et al., 2006). Besides this, prior to flock colonization, Campylobacter spp. were detected in the environment (Rivoal et al., 2005; Bull et al., 2006). A case–control study indicates that among children, contact with animals or the environment is the source of a substantial proportion of sporadic Campylobacter infections (Ethelberg et al., 2005). Transmission by flies is discussed as a contributing factor to broiler prevalence and human campylobacteriosis (Ekdahl et al., 2005; Nichols, 2005). A systematic review evaluating the major contributing factors and sources of Campylobacter occurrence in broilers in Great Britain highlights the importance of hygienic measures in the primary production stage for decreasing the risk, while the highest disagreement between study results was in factors related to vertical transmission and carry-over (Adkin et al., 2006).\\n\\nSeasonality with a peak of broiler prevalence and campylobacteriosis in summer and autumn has been found in several studies (Wedderkopp et al., 2001; Nylen et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2004; Meldrum et al., 2005). Seasonal pattern and a dependence on latitude indicate that climate factors might play a role either directly or indirectly. A seasonal pattern in Campylobacter contamination was found in a river, and a decrease in notified cases of campylobacteriosis was observed when levels of Campylobacter were low (Eyles et al., 2003). Ambient temperature has been described as a factor that might contribute to the seasonal variation of campylobacteriosis (Louis et al., 2005; Fleury et al., 2006). Specific climate conditions that lead to an increase in broiler prevalence and in campylobacteriosis after different time lags have been hypothesized (Patrick et al., 2004; Kovats et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2006). Significant differences in Campylobacter colonization rates were observed between chickens raised under high and low relative humidity conditions (Line, 2006). Rainfall was found to be a risk factor for Campylobacter infection (Sandberg et al., 2006).\\n\\nIn order to fulfil the requirements prescribed by the zoonosis directive 2003/99/EC, the broiler flocks were sampled in Germany.

Time series techniques were used to address both the aims.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Broiler-monitoring-related data\\n\\nThe raw data used in this study was from the German Campylobacter monitoring programme in broiler flocks between May 2004 and June 2007. This programme consists of convenience sampling in 14 larger poultry abattoirs in different geographical regions in Germany. Each abattoir processes at least 2000 broilers per slaughter-batch from a given farm and in these 14 abattoirs more than 80% of the broiler flocks in Germany are processed (Peters et al., 2006). Within the programme, cloacal samples from ten broilers were selected from each slaughter-batch, pooled and tested for Campylobacter spp. in compliance with ISO 10272/1 in one of eight regional labs. Test results and all identified Campylobacter isolates were submitted to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) for further analysis and evaluation. The information required for our study was extracted from the monitoring database, checked for consistency, and analysed using the statistical software package SPSS (SPSS version 14.0 SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\\n\\nFor the time series analysis, four variables of the database were selected: the status of the pool faecal sample for Campylobacter (positive/negative), the federal state (Bundesland) in which the primary production is located, the date of arrival of the samples from the slaughterhouses at the regional labs and the number of animals per slaughter-batch. The whole dataset contained 3382 records. For the sample submission and prevalence time series 3360 records and for the weighted prevalence time series 2888 records were taken into account. Main exclusion criteria were missing or implausible data.\\n\\n© 2008 The Authors\\n\\nJournal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Verlag • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 117–128\\n---\\n# Campylobacter Monitoring\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\na {\\ncolor: #2980b9;\\n}\\n\\n# Campylobacter Monitoring\\n\\n# Human Campylobacterioses Data\\n\\nHuman campylobacterioses cases data, based on the mandatory notification system according to the Act for Protection against Infectious Diseases, were obtained from the Robert Koch Institute website (http://www3.rki.de/SurvStat, accessed on 18.04.2007). As output variables, the total monthly number of campylobacterioses and the monthly incidence per 100,000 inhabitants for the period January 2001 to December 2006 were selected. In Germany, the total recorded number of human campylobacterioses comprised 346,427 cases within 6 years ranging from 50,614 to 64,610 cases per year. In Lower Saxony, the number of campylobacterioses totalled 28,286 cases (4,007–5,443 per year).\\n\\n# Climate Data\\n\\nClimate data were obtained from the German National Meteorological Service website, (the Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD) (http://www.dwd.de/de/FundE/Klima/KLIS/daten/online/nat/ausgabe_monatswerte.htm, website accessed on 02.09.2007) for the station 10338 Hanover Langenhagen in Lower Saxony. The following variables (summarized by month) were included in the database: the mean temperature (TMM) and the maximum temperature (TXX) two metres above ground in degrees Celsius, the total sunshine duration (SOS) in hours, the total precipitation (RSS) and the maximum diurnal precipitation total (RSX) in millimetres and the mean wind-force (FMM) in Beaufort, for the time span January 2001–June 2007.\\n\\n# Preparation of Time Series Data Sets\\n\\nTime series is a sequence of data points measured at equal time intervals. The time series for the study were generated by cross-tabulation of the original data of the monitoring programme to obtain aggregated data on a monthly and a weekly basis. Three different time series data sets were generated for weekly and monthly time windows. The outcome variables for the time series were first the total number of samples, second the proportion of positive samples and third the weighted for the batch-size proportion of positive samples. The weighting was done in Excel for Windows by summing the number of animals in each of the time periods (week or month), normalizing this sum to one and calculating the fraction of the positive samples. To generate time series for campylobacterioses, the data from the Robert Koch Institute and the climate data were directly transferred into SPSS. Time series plots were performed for all series to visualize possible trends and seasonality.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis of Data\\n\\n# Autocorrelation Function\\n\\nAutocorrelation of all time series data sets was assessed by empirical autocorrelation function (ACF), indicating a correlation of data at current time (t0) with data from previous time points, i.e. lagging 1, 2, or more time points. ACF values range between -1 and +1, with values near to these borders indicating strong positive or negative correlation between current values and previous observations. A plot of the ACF (or correlogram) is a useful check for seasonality and other time series patterns (Makridakis et al., 1998). The x-axis represents the different time lags and the y-axis the ACF values. The approximate standard errors for the autocorrelation coefficients were calculated on the assumption that the underlying process is either independent or white noise (Chatfield, 2004). For testing the entire set of autocorrelation coefficients for significance, the Box–Ljung test based on the asymptotic chi-square approximation was used.\\n\\n# Seasonal Decomposition\\n\\nAll time series data were decomposed into a trend component, a seasonal component and a residual error. As the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations did not vary proportionally to increases or decreases of the time series by visual inspection and assuming that the size of the seasonal effect is constant from year to year, seasonal decomposition was done in an additive way in SPSS, leading to trend-cycle series, seasonally adjusted series, seasonal factors and errors for the human campylobacteriosis and the climate data. In this procedure, the seasonal factors estimate the seasonal component, which contribute to the time series pattern. If subtracted from the original time series, the seasonally adjusted series is obtained. As the data from the broiler monitoring programme ranged only over 3 years to estimate both deseasonalized time series and seasonal factors, the following procedure was applied. First, a centred moving average with a time span of 12 was calculated for all time series (12MA). The resulting time series represents then a smoothed trend-cycle. By subtraction of the 12MA series from the original time series resulting in a detrended time series and calculation of the mean monthly differences the seasonal factors were obtained. Subtracting the seasonal factors from the original data generated a deseasonalized series. For estimating the errors, the seasonal factors were subtracted from the detrended time series.\\n\\n# Cross-Correlation\\n\\nIn order to evaluate the relationship between Campylobacter isolates in broiler, human campylobacterioses and climate, cross-correlation functions using the...\\n\\n© 2008 The Authors.

Hartnack et al.\\n\\n# Cross-Correlation Analysis\\n\\nThe cross-correlation function of the Trends module in SPSS was calculated among the prevalence time series in broilers, the incidence time series in humans, and the climate time series. The lag time for analysis of cross-correlation refers to a shift between the two time series. For example, at lags -1, 0, and 1, the correlation of the human incidence with the prevalence in broilers 1 month earlier, during the same month, and 1 month later is estimated. This was done with the original time series and the deseasonalized time series for the relationship between prevalence in broiler and human campylobacterioses. The approximate standard error for the cross-correlation coefficients was calculated on the assumption that the series are not cross-correlated and that one of the series is white noise.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Broiler Monitoring Data\\n\\n# Sample Submission and Prevalence\\n\\nBecause of data quality, time series for sample submission and prevalence were determined solely on a monthly basis. The sample submission and the prevalence of Campylobacter are shown in Table 1. During the years of the study period, which comprised for 2004 the period from May to December and for 2007 the period from January to June, a decrease in sample submission was found. Samples from animals originating from Lower Saxony contributed to 62% of the total number of samples, while the other 13 federal states each accounted for less than 10% of the total sample size. Therefore, further analyses were performed both for Germany as a whole and for Lower Saxony separately.\\n\\nThe pattern of sample submission throughout the year is quite similar in Germany as a whole and in Lower Saxony. The highest number of samples was submitted in May and June, whereas distinctly lower numbers were found in April, July, and October, corresponding to the prime holiday periods. Time plots for the weekly and monthly prevalence and weighted prevalence for Germany and Lower Saxony showed a high variability with values (graph not shown). The highest prevalence was detected during the summer months June to September. The prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler was considered to be slightly higher in Lower Saxony as compared with Germany as a whole. The weighted weekly and monthly prevalences are lower for Germany as a whole and Lower Saxony as compared with the prevalence without weighting. The variable number of animals per slaughter-batch varied between 500 and 220,001 with a median of 20,100. No significant difference in the number of animals per slaughter-batch size could be found between Campylobacter positive or negative tested slaughter-batches by a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon P = 0.054). Autocorrelation plots for the sample submissions and the prevalence in Lower Saxony show distinct patterns: Whereas the sample submission shows significant positive autocorrelation for time lags 6 and 12, the prevalence in broilers displays sinusoidal behaviour with significant positive autocorrelation for time lags 1, 2, and 12 and significant negative autocorrelation for time lags 5, 6, and 7.\\n\\n# Table 1.

For Germany as a whole, the highest rates are found in July and August (ranging from 83.2 to 129.5) and the lowest rates in March and April (ranging from 36.3 to 60.9). Similarly in Lower Saxony, the highest rates are found in July and August (ranging from 68.3 to 112.6) and the lowest rates in March and April (ranging from 29.6 to 45.8). An autocorrelation plot for the human incidence in Lower Saxony indicates a sinusoidal behaviour with significant positive autocorrelation for time lags 1, 2, and 10–13 and significant negative autocorrelation for time lags 4–8.\\n\\nA decomposition plot for human incidence of campylobacterioses in Lower Saxony including the original time series, the monthly seasonal factors, a seasonally adjusted series, a trend-cycle component, and the errors, supports the strong seasonality. The errors of decomposition vary around 0 ranging from -13.7 to 10.1 and are normally distributed. The autocorrelation plot of the errors indicates significant positive autocorrelation coefficients at time lags 3, 6, and 14. The estimation of the seasonal factors and the deseasonalized series, principally based on a centered moving average of 12, display a similar pattern as compared with the classical decomposition obtained by SPSS. The 12MA resembles the trend-cycle component of the classical decomposition but it is smoother. The seasonally adjusted series of the classical decomposition are similar to the.\\n\\n© 2008 The Authors\\n\\nJournal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Verlag • Zoonoses Public Health. 56 (2009) 117–128\\n---\\n# Campylobacter Monitoring\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n.graph {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Campylobacter Monitoring\\n\\nFig. 1.

The upper and the lower confidence limits refer to the 95% confidence limits.\\n\\nThe estimated deseasonalized series shows errors varying from -16.1 to 17.1, which are normally distributed. Decomposition of the prevalence data of the broiler monitoring programme was not possible due to insufficient data for at least four seasonal periods or years. Estimation of deseasonalized time series was performed using a moving average of 12 and several subtractions (Fig. 3a–e). The autocorrelation plot of the errors indicates positive and significant autocorrelation at time lags 1, 6, and 8 lags.\\n\\nCross-correlation between Campylobacteriosis and Campylobacter prevalence in broilers.\\n\\nAs the human incidence is calculated annually for the number of inhabitants, the data used for calculation of cross-correlation comprised the period January 2004–December 2006. Plots of the time series for broiler prevalence, human campylobacterioses, and temperature exhibit similar seasonality (Fig. 4a–c). Cross-correlation function plots reveal strong correlations between human incidence and both the prevalence and weighted prevalence in broilers at different time lags (-1 to 2) with positive correlation (Fig. 5). Notably, the positive coefficients are not symmetric around lag 0, indicating that the peak in campylobacterioses precedes the peak in broiler prevalence.\\n\\nThis result requires careful interpretation as the autocorrelations present in the original time series might cause spurious cross-correlations.

In order to detect possible trends in antibiotic resistance, at least 170 Campylobacter isolates should be examined each year. This demand was largely met during the years 2004–2006. Our aim was to answer the question whether this database could be additionally explored by time series analysis in order to identify temporal patterns in the sample submission pattern and the infection prevalences in broiler flocks in Germany, and temporal links to the climate patterns and human Campylobacter monitoring data.\\n\\nClassical seasonal decomposition is preferably performed with longer time series comprising (if possible) observations over several years or even decenniums to detect seasonal and trend-cycle patterns. In our study, data were only available for 6 years for the human campylobacterioses and for 38 months for the Campylobacter prevalence in broilers. We consider this time-span long enough to detect seasonality (annual patterns) in the time series. For describing reliable trend-cycle patterns, longer time series would be needed. The question about appropriate length for time series to be analysed in monitoring programmes should be carefully addressed, as over a long time period other influences like changes in diagnostic techniques and disease awareness might play a role, too.\\n\\nWe focussed on the description of sample submission and prevalence during the year and the relation between sample submission and prevalence. Further, we considered the relationship in time between prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler and incidence of campylobacterioses in humans and the climate data temperature, rainfall and wind-force. The most striking finding of this study is that the data indicate that the seasonal peak in human campylobacterioses preceded, rather than followed, the peak in broiler prevalence. This result is in accordance with a study comparing the peak of human Campylobacter infections (early June) with Campylobacter isolation rates from fresh retail chicken samples (late June) (Meldrum et al., 2005).'),\n",

This result is in accordance with a study comparing the peak of human Campylobacter infections (early June) with Campylobacter isolation rates from fresh retail chicken samples (late June) (Meldrum et al., 2005).\\n\\nIf the effect of season is removed by seasonal decomposition in the time series human campylobacterioses and in the time series broiler prevalence data, the cross-correlation between these two time series is substantially reduced but still present at time lag 0. It should be noted that the time of notification of human campylobacteriosis and not the date of infection or disease onset is recorded. This raises the question about the relative importance of Campylobacter in poultry for human campylobacterioses and leads to the hypothesis that poultry may not be the main source of infection for humans, but humans and poultry may be infected by a common source (Hudson et al., 1999; Skelly and Weinstein, 2003).\\n\\nThe relative importance of human campylobacterioses because of contaminated poultry is considered to be between 20–40% (Havelaar et al., 2007) in the Netherlands to 80% frequency of food-borne transmission in the USA (Mead et al., 1999). Several authors agree that there is a need for quantifying the contribution of different sources to campylobacterioses (Patrick et al., 2004; Conlan et al., 2007; Karenlampi et al., 2007).\\n\\nThe Dioxin Crisis in Belgium in 1999 led to the complete withdrawal of poultry products originating from Belgium, and simultaneously a decrease in notified campylobacterioses was detected. This decrease was estimated to be 40% as compared with the expected number (Vellinga and Van Loock, 2002).\\n\\nAnother finding of our study is that the correlation between climate data and human campylobacterioses seems to be stronger than between climate data and broiler prevalence. It is difficult to directly compare the suitability of the broiler and human campylobacterioses data for time series analysis, because both data were collected for different purposes and by totally different data-generating processes. The broiler-monitoring data can be described in terms of a sampling process with known sampling frame and sample sizes while the human data are based on absolute numbers of registered cases. Expected or potential sources of bias (e.g. selection bias for the broiler data and underreporting in the human data) were not addressed in this study.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the data for a study investigating the effects of climate on the incidence of Campylobacter spp. in humans and the prevalence in broiler flocks in Denmark related to all the broiler flocks slaughtered.\\n\\n© 2008 The Authors.

Hartnack et al.\\n\\nDuring the period of the study, climate factors with some time lags prior were found to be more useful predictors for human incidence than for broiler flock prevalence (Patrick et al., 2004). The underlying reasons for the seasonality in human campylobacterioses and the Campylobacter prevalence in broilers remain elusive. Further research, preferably an approach that combines epidemiological, ecological, microbiological, and veterinary perspectives, seems necessary to assess the impact of bio-security measures on poultry farms and to reduce the public health burden due to Campylobacter.\\n\\nData used for the analysis were considered sufficient for an evaluation on a monthly but not on a weekly basis. Most countries, with the exception of Lower Saxony, contributed less than 10% to the total sample submission, leading to the decision to generate time series for Lower Saxony and for Germany as a whole. No marked difference was found between the situation of Campylobacter in broilers in Lower Saxony and in Germany as a whole in the database.\\n\\nIn case of limited resources, it could be advisable for future research to focus on Lower Saxony instead of trying to investigate different regions. Both sample submission and prevalence showed a strong seasonal pattern and a decrease over time, but the time pattern was not fully synchronized. The seasonality for sample submission seems related to the Easter, summer, and autumn holidays, while the prevalence peaks in the summer months appear related to climate factors, mainly the temperature in the same month and the two previous months.\\n\\nA study investigating environmental temperatures and the incidence of food poisoning using deseasonalized data detected a strong association between a rise in food poisoning and temperatures 2–5 weeks earlier (Bentham and Langford, 2001). One limitation of this study was that the available data did not allow generating time series on a weekly basis. The decrease in sample submission and prevalence poses no problem for antibiotic resistance monitoring, as a sufficient number of samples were still examined. However, this decrease could hinder an appropriate estimation of prevalence.\\n\\nThe extreme values of 0% or 100% prevalence are mainly due to a very low number of submitted samples, which were all negative or positive. This variability in prevalence aligns with the inconclusive data for Campylobacter prevalence in broilers in the literature and underscores the need for a baseline study based on sample sizes that are representative of the animals, geographic origin, and time point during the year when the samples are taken. It would be useful if a minimum number of sample submissions per month could be examined.\\n\\nThe demand for appropriate comparable sampling techniques and enumeration methods, which are important for the evaluation of quantitative data (Scherer et al., 2006; Rasschaert et al., 2007), is presumed to be met by the organization of the broiler-monitoring programme. Despite the fact that this monitoring programme is based on convenience sampling in the slaughterhouses and regional labs and is not designed for appropriate prevalence estimation, it still allows the description of Campylobacter prevalence dynamics in broilers over the year.\\n\\nThe sampling scheme with a pool of 10 cloacal samples per slaughter-batch is considered justified as the spread of Campylobacter in a poultry flock is described to occur in a few days, and the probability that all animals will be either positive or negative or that the within-herd prevalence is close to 100% is very high (Berndtson et al., 1996; Evans and Sayers, 2000). The weightage factor based on the variable number of animals per slaughter-batch was calculated and used to generate weighted prevalence time series. The aim was to account for possible bias in the prevalence estimation due to the sampling scheme of a fixed number of 10 cloacal samples regardless of the slaughter-batch size.\\n\\nThe slaughter-batch size was assumed to be identical to the flock size. The effect of weighting was that the prevalence was generally lower compared to the non-weighted time series. However, slaughter-batch size was not significantly different in Campylobacter positive or negative slaughter-batches. This finding aligns with another study (Regula et al., 2005) and indicates that correction for slaughter-batch size does not improve the estimation of prevalence.\\n\\nThe approach of seasonal decomposition was chosen to eliminate seasonal factors and examine time-dependent but non-seasonal factors that explain the relationship between Campylobacter in broilers and campylobacterioses in humans. After removing trend and seasonal effects through decomposition, the time series did not exhibit any pattern, suggesting that the variability over time can be sufficiently explained by a trend and a seasonal component.\\n\\nTo describe the time series of incidence in more detail by a model, which was beyond the scope of this study, it should be noted that some seasonality remains after decomposition, as shown by the significant autocorrelation coefficients of the errors at time lags 3, 6, and 14. The estimation of deseasonalized time series based on a 12MA was accomplished parallel to the incidence of campylobacterioses in humans and for the climate data to compare the results between the two methods, which were similar and thus reliable. As seasonal decomposition was not possible for the time series of prevalence in broilers due to a too short observation time, the estimation of deseasonalized time series proved to be a necessary step.\\n\\n© 2008 The Authors.

The overall pattern of seasonality is considered to be reliable and significant auto- and cross-correlation coefficients are meaningful. The data of the climate factors originate from one meteorological station in Lower Saxony. This introduces uncertainty in the interpretation of the results. For further research on the interactions between the occurrence of Campylobacter in humans and in broilers, the meteorological data from several stations should be used to account for the variability in the data.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAdkin, A., E.

To demonstrate the proposed technique, we examined seasonal patterns of six enterically transmitted reportable diseases (EDs) in Massachusetts collected over a 10-year period (1992–2001). We quantified the timing and intensity of seasonal peaks of ED incidence and examined the synchronization in timing of these peaks with respect to ambient temperature. All EDs, except hepatitis A, exhibited well-defined seasonal patterns which clustered into two groups. The peak in daily incidence of Campylobacter and Salmonella closely followed the peak in ambient temperature with a lag of 2–14 days. Cryptosporidium, Shigella, and Giardia exhibited significant delays relative to the peak in temperature (approximately 40 days, P<0.02). The proposed approach provides a detailed quantification of seasonality that enabled us to detect significant differences in the seasonal peaks of enteric infections which would have been lost in an analysis using monthly or weekly cumulative information. This highly relevant to disease surveillance approach can be used to generate and test hypotheses related to disease seasonality and potential routes of transmission with respect to environmental factors.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn temperate climates, waterborne or foodborne enteric infections typically alternate periods of low endemic levels with periods of outbreaks, forming a typical seasonal pattern. For example, illness caused by Salmonella spp. or Campylobacter jejuni rises in the summer and declines in the winter. Enteric infections caused by the protozoans Giardia and Cryptosporidium also exhibit seasonal variation, although shifted towards autumn. In contrast, hepatitis A and shigellosis seasonality is not marked.\\n\\nConsistent temporal fluctuations for diseases with similar sources for exposure or similar routes of transmission suggest the presence of environmental factors that synchronize seasonal variation. Deviations from an established seasonal pattern may provide important clues to the factors that influence disease occurrence. These factors may include changes in the sources of exposure and spread, changes in the affected population, or differences in the pathogen itself. Ecological disturbances, perhaps from climate change, may also play a role.\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: E. N.

Ambient temperature has been associated with short-term temporal variations in reported cases of food poisoning, often caused by Salmonella. Increased temperatures and extreme precipitation events have also been shown to have a short-term effect on health outcomes. To quote Epstein, ‘climate constrains the range of infectious diseases, while weather affects the timing and intensity of outbreaks’. It is plausible that the temporal pattern in ambient temperature may determine, in part, the timing and magnitude of the peak of a disease incidence curve for specific enteric diseases.\\n\\nAn understanding of how specific environmental factors influence human disease may improve disease forecasting, enhance the design of integrated warning systems, and advance the development of efficient outbreak detection algorithms. Although seasonality is a well-known characteristic of enteric infections, simple analytical tools for the examination, evaluation, and comparison of seasonal patterns are limited. Herein, we offer a framework for seasonality assessment, and a parametric approach for seasonality evaluation. We contrast our approach with non-parametric modelling. To demonstrate the proposed method, while providing step-by-step instructions for implementation, we examine the variability in seasonality of six enteric diseases with respect to ambient temperature in the temperate climate of Massachusetts (MA) over the last decade. We consider two parasite infections (Giardia and Cryptosporidium), three bacterial infections (Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella), and one viral disease, hepatitis A. All of these enteric infections can be waterborne and/or foodborne, have low endemic winter incidence rates and localized outbreaks, typically exhibit a yearly summer or autumn peak, and are diseases reportable to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH).\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Data Abstraction\\n\\nWe abstracted all reported laboratory-confirmed cases (45,816 records, without personal identifiers) for six diseases: giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, shigellosis, and hepatitis A. The number of cases by disease is shown in Table 1. The abstraction covers all of MA over a 10-year period (3653 days) from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2001. Criteria for reportable cases to MDPH include: for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis – demonstration of Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia lamblia cysts in stool; demonstration of Cryptosporidium or G. lamblia cysts in intestinal fluid or small-bowel biopsy specimens; or demonstration of Cryptosporidium or G. lamblia antigen in stool by a specific immunodiagnostic test (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)); for salmonellosis (non-typhoid) and shigellosis – isolation of Salmonella or Shigella species from any clinical specimen; for hepatitis A – serological evidence of recent hepatitis A virus infection (anti-hepatitis A IgM antibody) associated with a consistent clinical syndrome, or known exposure to an infectious case with or without symptoms in the contact. For each reported case, variables necessary for spatial and temporal analysis were collected.\\n---\\n# Seasonality in Six Enteric Diseases and Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.equation {\\nfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\\nbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder-left: 3px solid #007BFF;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality in Six Enteric Diseases and Temperature\"),\n",

Using the date of disease onset, the time series of daily counts of reported laboratory-confirmed cases of the six enteric diseases (EDs) were created.\\n\\nDaily ambient temperature records from 38 MA monitoring stations were abstracted from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Summary of the Day database (EarthInfo Inc., Boulder, CO, USA). A daily average of recorded maximum temperature was calculated from all active stations. On any given day, data were available from at least 94% of stations. Of the 14 MA counties, 12 counties had from 1 to 6 active stations. The counties with the most stations [Worcester (6), Essex (5), Middlesex (5), and Plymouth (5)] include half of MA’s population. The two counties without stations, Franklin and Nantucket, are among the least densely populated in the state. A time series of the daily averaged maximum ambient temperature was created.\\n\\n# Conceptual Framework for Seasonality Assessment\\n\\nWe define ‘seasonality’ as systematic, or repetitive, periodic fluctuations in a variable of interest (i.e. disease incidence or environmental exposure, e.g. temperature) that occur within the course of a year. It can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. We define the time of the seasonal peak, a parameter of interest, as the position of the maximum point on the seasonal curve. The maximum and minimum values on the seasonal curve, the difference between, and the ratio of these values are the magnitude-related measures. The conceptual framework for measuring the temporal relation between seasonal patterns in environmental temperatures and disease incidence is shown in Figure 1. The synchronization in disease incidence and environmental factors can be viewed as a special case when multiple time series exhibit common periodicities and can be characterized, in part, by a lag, a difference between peak timing in disease incidence and exposure.\\n\\nThis conceptual framework is expressed via model (1) as follows:\\n\\nY(t) = c cos(2πvt + y) + e(t)  (1)\\n\\nwhere Y(t) is a time series; the periodic component has a frequency of v, an amplitude of c, and a phase angle of y; and {e(t), t=1, 2, …, n} is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables with E[e(t)]=0 and Var[e(t)]=σ². This easy-to-interpret model describes a seasonal curve by a cosine function with symmetric rise and fall over a period of a full year. The locations of two points, the seasonal curve peak and nadir, can be determined using a shift, or phase angle parameter, y, which reflects the timing of the peak relative to the origin. If y=1, there is no shift of the peak relative to the origin, and the curve peaks in the summer on the 182nd day; if 1<y<2 then there is a shift towards autumn; and if 0<y<1 then the shift is towards spring. For convenience, an origin can be set at the calendar year beginning 1 January, but it can also be reset at any other day. The shift parameter can be expressed in days and used for seasonality comparison. The amplitude of fluctuations between two extreme points is controlled via parameter c. If c=0, there is no seasonal increase. Estimates of model (1) are difficult to obtain because both y and c are unknown, but its equivalent model (2):\\n\\nY(t) = b₁ sin(2πvt) + b₂ cos(2πvt) + e(t)  (2)\\n\\nis easy to fit by the least squares procedure available in commercial statistical software programs. Elsewhere, we have proposed an approach, which allows us to combine the ease of fitting model (2) and the simplicity and elegance of interpretation of model (1), by using the d-method. We demonstrated that estimates of the amplitude and shift parameters of model (1) can be obtained from the estimates of model (2): for the amplitude, the estimates of the mean and variance are:\\n\\n^1, ^2 = d(b₁² + b₂²)^(1/2)\\n\\nwhere d=1, if b>0, and d=x₁, if b₂<0.\\n\\nParametric modelling procedures: To describe the seasonal pattern in the daily time series of temperature and infections and estimate its parameters, we used generalized linear models (GLM) with a Gaussian distribution for ambient temperature as the outcome variable of interest using model A:\\n\\nY(t) = b₀ + b₁ sin(2πvt) + b₂ cos(2πvt) + e(t)  (3)\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Seasonality Characteristics\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Seasonality Characteristics\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis paper discusses the characteristics of seasonality in relation to temperature and disease incidence.

Characteristics of seasonality: Graphical depiction and definition for daily time series of exposure (ambient temperature) and outcome (disease incidence) variables. The red labels are related to exposure measures and the blue labels are related to disease incidence measures.\\n\\n# Modeling Approach\\n\\nWe utilize two models to analyze the data:\\n\\n1. Model A: A Poisson distribution for daily disease counts.\\n2. Model B: A sinusoidal model represented as follows:\\n\\nlog [Y(t)] = b0 + b1 sin(2πvt) + b2 cos(2πvt) + e(t)\\n\\nIn both models, b0 is an intercept, representing a baseline of a seasonal pattern, and t is time in days (t=1, 2, …, N, where N is the number of days in a time series). To properly express the frequency, we set v=1/N.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nBy estimating the amplitude and phase angle parameters, we can derive confidence intervals for the proposed characteristics, enhancing our understanding of the relationship between temperature and disease incidence.\\n---\\n# Seasonality in Six Enteric Diseases and Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality in Six Enteric Diseases and Temperature\\n\\n# Table 2: Reported Laboratory-Confirmed Infections and Their Seasonal Characteristics\"),\n",

For each estimate, we calculated a corresponding 95% confidence interval.\\n\\nTo describe a period of seasonal increase, we determined weeks with high rates: if the predicted number of cases for week i, Ri, had a value less than a pre-specified cut point, we assigned this week to a period of seasonal increase.\\n\\nWe selected three cut points as the 75th, 85th, and 95th percentiles of a distribution of predicted weekly cases.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThree-dimensional scatter plots with superimposed linear regression surfaces were created to illustrate temperature–ED incidence relations over time. These show 10-year trends in disease incidence, with respect to daily ambient temperature. The annual summer disease increase is far more pronounced than any of the annual trends for the six EDs.\\n\\nThe time series of daily values of ambient temperature is shown in the accompanying figures.\\n\\nDescriptive statistics of laboratory-confirmed reported cases for all six EDs are shown in Table 2. Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Giardia are the most commonly reported EDs in MA. Due to outbreaks, the range of daily fluctuation is poorly captured by the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the difference between the daily maximum and the daily mean typically exceeds seven standard deviations.\\n\\nReporting of Cryptosporidium was low until 1995, when an unusual number of cryptosporidiosis cases were diagnosed in Worcester, MA.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Disease Trends\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Disease Trends and Seasonal Characteristics\\n\\nFig. 2.

The magnitude and timing of a seasonal increase, estimated from model A (for temperature) and model B (for ED), are shown in Table 2. The seasonal curve for ambient temperature peaked at the 206th day of the year (typically 24 or 25 July, week 29) with an average maximum temperature of approximately 28.89 °C.\\n\\nReported Campylobacter incidence essentially coincided with the peak in temperature (day 208, P=0.89). Salmonella incidence peaked 13 days after the peak in ambient temperature. In another group, reported cryptosporidiosis and shigellosis peaked contemporaneously almost 1 month after the temperature peak (242, P<0.02 and 247, P<0.01). Reported giardiasis peaked 1 week after cryptosporidiosis (249, P<0.01), in the first week of September.\\n\\nThe small variability in the timing of these seasonal peaks reflects the consistency of the seasonal pattern for these diseases. The variability exhibited by Salmonella and other diseases is illustrated in the following figures.\\n\\nFig. 3.

Shaded regions indicate where estimated seasonal peaks fall.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nAlthough seasonality is a well-known phenomenon in the epidemiology of many diseases, simple analytical tools for the examination, evaluation, and comparison of seasonal patterns are limited. Analyses of disease seasonality have also been restricted by the lack of precision inherent in using monthly or weekly means. Herein we offer a framework for uniform, comprehensive, systematic, seasonality assessment via a parametric approach, using daily frequencies. This approach is highly relevant to disease surveillance, which sifts through daily frequencies of disease as well as specially designed epidemiological studies. We propose simple, easily understood characteristics for the intensity and timing of a seasonal peak. These allow us to quantify seasonality in a consistent manner and to compare relationships between diseases and environmental factors.\\n\\nWe applied this approach to the study of enteric diseases in Massachusetts. We found that infections caused by Salmonella and Campylobacter closely follow the ambient temperature curve. If we knew nothing else, we might hypothesize that Salmonella and Campylobacter infections share a dominant route of exposure that is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Foodborne transmission is an obvious candidate for this route, given the capacity of Salmonella to grow in contaminated food and the paucity of person-to-person spread with Campylobacter infections. Indeed, food contamination is believed to be the most significant mode of transmission for Salmonella and Campylobacter.\\n\\nIn contrast, the seasonal increase in Giardia, Shigella, and Cryptosporidium infections form a separate cluster peaking a month after the temperature peak, strongly suggesting different route(s) of exposure than for Salmonella or Campylobacter. Reasons for this month-long temporal delay (lag) include differences in routes of transmission, amplification of infection related to person-to-person spread, survival of pathogens in the environment, incubation periods after ingestion, differences in diseases manifestation and testing practices, or combinations thereof. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, or shigellosis associated with drinking water and recreational water use occur in the warm summer months. Hot weather leads to higher water consumption, promotes outdoor swimming and other recreational water use, and other outdoor activities. Person-to-person spread may also be increased due to the close quarters and poor hygiene of outdoor activities, such as camping or swimming, and person-to-person spread may amplify outbreaks pushing peaks to a later time period. Prior work suggests that contaminated water is a dominant source of exposure for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, although foodborne transmission is certainly possible.\\n\\nWe cannot comment on the possibility that foreign travel, presence of HIV infection, specific water sources, or specific recreational water exposures were involved in these findings, as the data collected by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not contain detailed information on these potential risk factors. The differences in seasonality between the first (Salmonella and Campylobacter infection) and the second cluster (Giardia, Shigella, and Cryptosporidium infections) could be in part associated with the probability of acute clinical syndromes, as well as testing and reporting practices. For each record in the database, a few dates were provided: date on event, date of disease onset, date of diagnosis, date of specimen collection, and date of reporting. We examined the differences amongst all the dates and selected the date of disease onset as the most reliable characteristic. In any passive surveillance, a delay...\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis Seasonality\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.acknowledgements {\\nmargin-top: 30px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis Seasonality\\n\\nBetween the time of clinical manifestation and the time of diagnosis and testing is practically unavoidable; however, we assume that this delay is systematic over the course of the year and the lag between the peak in ambient temperature and the peak in diseases includes this systematic component.\\n\\nThe seasonal pattern in cryptosporidiosis observed in this study differs from the seasonal patterns reported by others, where a slight increase in the number of positive stool tests for Cryptosporidium parvum and in the number of cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV patients occurred in the spring compared with other seasons, but the difference was not statistically significant [38]. This fact could be indicative of differences in predominant routes of exposure in the HIV-infected population. If there is a spring peak in cryptosporidiosis in MA, it is not captured in the surveillance data that we analyzed in this study, in part due to the fact that the highest fraction of samples for cryptosporidiosis came from children (60%) not adults. Although the surveillance data have been shown to be underreported and oversampled in certain situations, such as during the 1995 Worcester cryptosporidiosis outbreak [14], the established surveillance system on enteric infection has valuable potential for quantifying disease trends and seasonal patterns.\\n\\nIn this paper, we have assumed a common parametric form for seasonality, a cosine function. The shape of a cosine periodic function is defined by its shift parameter, which reflects the point of maximum amplitude, and by the length of a period, which implies that only one peak is observable in one calendar year. This assumption may not hold if a disease exhibits two seasonal peaks [39]; however, the proposed model can be extended so both peaks will be evaluated [26]. In any case, we recommend an exploration of the potential form for a seasonal pattern via nonlinear or non-parametric methods prior to modeling.\\n\\nWe compared our parametric approach with that of non-parametric modeling, which has an intuitive appeal and is often used for surveillance data (Table 3). The non-parametric model provides a reasonably good approximation for seasonal variation and allows one to make a reliably independent assessment of a specific week’s disease incidence against that of a reference week. However, this approach does not take into account temporal dependency and treats each week as a separate independent category. As expected, the non-parametric model with a set of indicator variables for weeks explained a larger percentage of the variability than did the parametric model using daily counts, in part due to a lesser impact of calendar effects (holidays or day of the week effects) in weekly aggregation. However, this possible advantage is strongly diminished by the major difficulties in comparing results of non-parametric models.'),\n",

However, this possible advantage is strongly diminished by the major difficulties in comparing results of non-parametric models.\\n\\nFor both non-parametric and parametric approaches, we utilized a Poisson regression model to predict ED incidence. Although a Poisson assumption is well suited for non-negative right-skewed outcomes, such as daily or weekly cases of infections, and can be a suitable approximation for a seasonal mean, we found the tails of the observed distributions of daily ED counts were longer than for a Poisson-like distribution. Approximation of the outcome by the Poisson distribution leads to the underestimation of predicted rates for days or weeks with very high rates, meaning that the actual degree of summer/autumn increase might be higher than predicted. We think that the model can be improved in the future by using more sophisticated tools for handling extreme values relating to outbreaks. However, until superimposed non-seasonal variation can be better predicted and identified, the selection of such tools is arbitrary.\\n\\nOne methodological aspect of this approach deserves special comment. The vast majority of epidemiological studies of ED seasonality have used crude quarterly or monthly aggregate data. This prevents a fully detailed, accurate, or comprehensive analysis of a seasonal pattern and may even be misleading [40]. The use of daily time series for these infections enabled us to detect significant differences in the seasonal peaks of enteric infections, which would have been lost in an analysis using monthly or weekly cumulative information. Examination of weekly rates substantially improves the evaluation of seasonal curves when compared to monthly data, but a systematic approach to the issue of week assignment in the long time series has often been lacking. The analysis of disease seasonality would benefit from the proposed approach, which can be used both as a routine in disease surveillance and as a part of specially designed epidemiological studies.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for support throughout this project and for providing us with surveillance data.

We have described the potential environmental determinants of the seasonal pattern of infection with campylobacter in Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Specifically, we investigated the role of climate variability on laboratory-confirmed cases of campylobacter infection from 15 populations. Regression analysis was used to quantify the associations between timing of seasonal peaks in infection in space and time. The short-term association between weekly weather and cases was also investigated using Poisson regression adapted for time series data. All countries in our study showed a distinct seasonality in campylobacter transmission, with many, but not all, populations showing a peak in spring. Countries with milder winters have peaks of infection earlier in the year. The timing of the peak of infection is weakly associated with high temperatures 3 months previously. Weekly variation in campylobacter infection in one region of the UK appeared to be little affected by short-term changes in weather patterns. The geographical variation in the timing of the seasonal peak suggests that climate may be a contributing factor to campylobacter transmission. The main driver of seasonality of campylobacter remains elusive and underscores the need to identify the major serotypes and routes of transmission for this disease.\\n---\\n# Seasonal Patterns of Campylobacter Infection\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.keywords {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns of Campylobacter Infection\\n\\nKeywords: Campylobacter · Seasonal variation · Food · Surveillance · Climate\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter is an important agent of enteritis. In England and Wales, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, campylobacter infection now accounts for more cases per year than salmonella (Schmidt and Tirado 2001; Blummer et al. 2003; Health Canada 2003). Species type is not routinely ascertained in surveillance but Campylobacter jejuni is thought to be the most commonly isolated species, accounting for around 80–90% of infections in England (IID Study Team 2002).\\n\\nTransmission occurs through consumption of contaminated food, water and milk products, as well as directly from animals and the environment. Risk factors identified for campylobacter infection include recent travel abroad (Schorr et al. 1994), occupational exposure in abattoirs and the consumption of chicken in restaurants (Eberhart-Phillips et al. 1997; Rodrigues et al. 2000). Water is thought to be an important route of transmission in New Zealand (Duncanson et al. 2000; Skelly and Weinstein 2003) and Canada (Clark et al. 2003). Treated drinking water can contain campylobacter but usually at levels considered too low to cause disease (Savill et al. 2001). In Norway, campylobacter levels in surface waters are generally higher in the colder months (Brennhovd et al. 1992; Obiri-Danso et al. 2001; Kapperud and Aasen 1992).\\n\\nReservoirs of campylobacter include a wide range of animals and birds. The spring peak of campylobacter may be related to birds and mammals foraging for food as activity in wild species generally increases after winter (Lacey 1993; Southern et al. 1990). The serotype distribution of Campylobacter in wildlife in Denmark was significantly different from known serotype distributions in broilers and humans, suggesting that the importance of wildlife as a reservoir of infection is limited (Petersen et al. 2001).\\n\\nPoultry are considered to be the most important source of campylobacter in food, although any raw meat may be contaminated with the bacteria. The consumption of chicken is estimated to account for between 40% and 70% of the human infections. Case control studies, however, have not consistently implicated particular food vehicles (de Wit et al. 2000; IID Study Team 2002). Campylobacter does not multiply in food and is seldom identified as a cause of common-source outbreaks of food poisoning.\\n\\nDespite the importance of poultry as a reservoir of infection, it does not explain the seasonal pattern in human infection. No seasonal variation was observed either in the prevalence of positive flocks, or in the percentage of birds infected in one area of the UK (Humphrey et al. 1993). However, one study found a summer peak in the prevalence of positive flocks and in the number of isolates in Lancashire, UK (Wallace et al. 1997). In Denmark, seasonal peaks in the prevalence of campylobacters in broiler chickens coincided with the seasonal pattern of human campylobacteriosis (Wedderkopp et al. 2000, 2001). The major peak in isolates in broiler chickens corresponds to a lesser second peak in humans seen in some countries, although this latter peak has also been associated with travel-related infections. Seasonal peaks in isolates in lambs, cattle and sewage generally appear 1–2 months prior to the peak in human infections indicating that this may be an important route of transmission (Stanley et al. 1998a, b; Wallace et al. 1997, 1998). However, it is possible that observed rates in animal reservoirs are biased by differences in surveillance intensity throughout the year. The seasonality of infection in pets does not correspond to the observed seasonality in humans (Lopez et al. 2002).\\n\\nIn this paper, we investigate the seasonal patterns of campylobacter infection using surveillance data for 15 populations in Europe, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. We also investigate any relationship of cases with meteorological factors in England and Wales, and the role of temperature in the timing of seasonal peaks of infection.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Surveillance Data\\n\\nSurveillance data on laboratory-confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis were obtained from national surveillance centres in the following countries: the Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Greece, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland (Schmidt and Tirado 2001), New Zealand, and Australia. Health Canada kindly supplied figures and information for comparison for Alberta. Data by species type or source/vehicle were unavailable.\\n\\nThere is an unknown and variable delay between the onset of illness and the date of report of confirmed infections to national surveillance systems. The average time from infection to the appearance of symptoms is a matter of days. The average time from becoming ill to a stool sample being sent to the laboratory varies between countries and depends on the health system and surveillance structures. In England and Wales, the mean delay between onset date and the date a specimen was recorded was 4.72 days, with over 90% of the specimen dates within 15 days of the onset date. We assume that the reported date corresponds to the onset date with an average delay, as reported by our partners in Table 1.\\n\\n# Meteorological Data'),\n",

The national series were validated against an independent national (monthly) data series. We used the Central England temperature series for England and Wales (Parker et al. 1992). Temperature data for Canada were supplied by the Meteorological Service of Canada (Environment Canada) and for Australia by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines. We used 92 stations in Alberta to ensure geographical representativeness for the region. For all countries, we obtained baseline national monthly and seasonal temperatures (averaged for years 1961–1990) from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research (dataset TYN_CY_1.1).\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Table 1: Surveillance Data Used and Estimated Delay Between Onset of Symptoms and Date Used in the Analysis (Weekly Series)\\n\\n|Country|Years of Data|Annual Average Count|Date Used|Estimated Delay from Onset of Illness|Peak Week (Data)|Peak Week (Onset)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Czech Republic|1993–2001|6,795|Onset date|0 Days|31|31|\\n|Denmark|1991–2000|1,664|Specimen arrived|8 Days|31|30|\\n|England/Wales|1989–1999|39,334|Specimen arrived|5 Days|22|21|\\n|Ireland|2000–2002|654|Specimen arrived|16–20 Days|32|29|\\n|Greece|1999–2002|286|Specimen arrived|10–15 Days|18|16|\\n|Malta|1997–2001|22|Alert date|0 Days|–|–|\\n|Netherlands|1995–2002|3,275|Laboratory test confirmed|12–16 Days|34|32|\\n|Scotland|1990–1999|2,844|Report date|16 Days|28|26|\\n|Spain|1989–2001|3,538|Laboratory test confirmed|30 Days|28|24|\\n|Switzerland|1990–2000|5,292|Report date|10 Days|32|30|\\n|Canada (Alberta)|1992–2000|1,074|Notification date|11 Days 2–3 Daysa|34|21b|\\n|New Zealand (North Island)|1991–2000|5,130|Notification date| |27b|21b|\\n|New Zealand (South Island)|1991–2000|1,896|Notification date|2–3 Days|18b|27b|\\n|Australia (Melbourne)|1991–2001|2,173|Onset date|0 Days|20b|18b|\\n|Australia (Brisbane)|1991–2001|1,335|Onset date|0 Days| |20|\\n\\na After specimen arrival\\n\\nb Estimated at number of weeks from 1 July (week 28)\\n\\n# Study Design\\n\\nThe surveillance data were converted to weekly series (i.e., total number of cases per week). Each series was averaged by week for all years of data available and the seasonal patterns were plotted. At the first stage of the analysis, the relationship of campylobacter with short-term weather effects was investigated for the North East region of England. This region was chosen because rainfall patterns were relatively homogenous and the public water supplies were primarily from surface water sources within the region, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting a potential water-borne transmission route. Weekly numbers of campylobacter cases were plotted against various weather parameters in this region to determine any crude associations. The relationships were summarized by smoothing the data using natural cubic splines of each weather variable as part of the Poisson generalised linear models (Kovats et al. 2004).\\n\\nThe next stage of the analysis concerned the more specific question of whether the timing of the peak of cases is affected by seasonal temperature variability. The “peak” week for each year was defined as the maximum total weekly count of cases each year. Conditional logistic regression models were used for this purpose with time to occurrence of the peak week each year as the dependent variable. To control for confounding from seasonal factors other than temperature, the analysis was matched on week. To explore the possibility of long time delays between temperature exposure and peak infection, the temperature series was lagged and then averaged across various weeks before being simultaneously entered into the model. Results are presented for the Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Scotland, Spain, and Switzerland combined because the data were of suitable length and quality, although no allowance was made for possible clustering by year or country.\\n\\nTo investigate the role of climate variability between countries in determining the timing of infection, peak week was correlated with average winter (December–February) and spring (March–May) temperatures. For southern hemisphere populations, peak weeks were estimated as the number of weeks from 1 July (week 28). Additional countries were included from a previous study that reported the peak week for Austria, Germany, Sweden, France, Finland, and Norway (Nylen et al. 2002). All analyses were undertaken in STATA version 8 (STATA 2003) or SPSS version 12 (SPSS 2003).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nMany countries showed an early spring peak (typically in April or May); however, not all countries followed this pattern (Fig. 1). The Czech Republic appeared to have two peaks of infection in summer. Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands had late summer peaks with the peak of cases occurring after the peak of temperature, and these may be associated with foreign travel. The seasonality was less pronounced in Australian cities than in New Zealand. There was also a difference in seasonality between North and South Island. In Alberta, Canada, infections peaked in late June–early July, and were lowest in February–March. The timing of the peak showed least variation from year to year in England and Wales, Greece, Denmark, and the Netherlands (SD <2 weeks). The timing of the peak was most unstable in Spain (SD 8 weeks) where the seasonal peak in spring was not clearly defined. Most countries with >8 years of data showed a small decline in seasonality over the last decade, but in no country was this trend statistically significant (results not shown).\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the simple relationships between weather parameters and numbers of cases of campylobacter infection in the North East region of England. The correlations are crude (i.e., not adjusted for potential confounders) and have splines overlaid to help summarize the basic relationship. The relationships shown are with weather in the previous week (lag 1), although results were also similar at longer lag periods.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Transmission\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns of Infection'),\n",

Weekly total campylobacter cases (and weekly mean temperature, averaged across all years) were found with temperature in other regions in the UK and in other countries (not shown). Rainfall (averaged for North East England) and humidity in the previous month had little effect on the transmission of cases. However, the effect of temperature (and the closely linked parameter of sunshine hours) is more complex, and may have some influence on transmission during the beginning of the campylobacter “season”.\\n\\n# Analysis of Temperature and Infection Timing\\n\\nTable 2 shows results of the analysis between temperature and the timing of the peak in candidate countries. Odds ratios are given for a 1°C increase in the temperature measure. The only association that reached statistical significance at the 5% level was an increase in cases associated with exposure to temperature measured 10–14 weeks prior to infection. Temperature accounted for only 4% of the inter-annual variability of the timing of the peaks. The estimates were similar when recalculated without the Spanish data series, as this country showed a different seasonal pattern.\\n\\nFig. 1 Seasonal patterns of infection with campylobacter. Weekly total campylobacter cases (and weekly mean temperature, averaged across all years).\\n\\n# Variation in Climate and Timing of Peak Infection\\n\\nFigure 3 illustrates the variation in climate and timing of peak infection between countries. In Australia/New Zealand, spring was defined as September–November and winter as June–August. Countries with warmer climates were shown to have earlier peaks. Table 3 shows that there was a fairly strong degree of correlation between both mean winter (r=0.62) and spring temperature (r=0.67) and the timing of peak of reported cases.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThere is a wide and varying literature in relation to campylobacter transmission mechanisms and seasonality, both within humans and animal species. The transmission of campylobacteriosis in humans is a complex ecological process with multiple hosts and routes (Skelly and Weinstein 2003). The literature does not imply a single main transmission route that would explain the seasonal pattern in human cases. We found that climate factors explain some differences in the seasonal variation between countries. Milder winter temperatures may favour some transmission routes, as well as enhance the survival and multiplication of the bacteria in the environment.\\n\\nWe were unable to find a strong effect of temperature variability on campylobacter transmission at either the short time scales (weather) or at longer (seasonal) time scales.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Cases and Weather Variables\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Cases and Weather Variables\\n\\n# Figure 2\\n\\nCrude relationship of campylobacter cases with weather variables in the North East region of England.

Although there is some evidence that outbreaks of infection with pathogens such as cryptosporidium are linked to extreme rainfall in conjunction with water treatment failures, the evidence for sporadic cases is lacking.

We have made several assumptions about the timing of seasonal peaks. Only a proportion of cases in the community are reported in national surveillance data, and those reported cases are not necessarily representative of all cases (Tam et al. 2003).\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nGiven the lack of routine direct surveillance of infectious disease morbidity, surveillance data are the best source of information available. Where possible, we have validated our assumptions by comparing reporting date with information on the onset of illness. We excluded data series from the regression analyses where the number of years was small, or where the number of cases per year was small (Malta).\\n\\nThe data from most countries were case-based (i.e., repeat isolates from the same patient were excluded from the data series). Cases associated with travel were excluded from data for England/Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Our analysis was limited by the lack of data from countries in southern Europe and by the lack of long time series (>10 years).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe relative importance of transmission routes may vary within countries, as has been shown in New Zealand (Hearnden et al. 2003).

Further studies are needed when data become available that can identify the effect of climate on the different campylobacter species and animal reservoirs.\\n\\nThe role of weather in triggering short-term increases in infection has yet to be resolved. There are various potential transmission routes (water supplies, bird activity, food borne and recreational contact) that could be affected by weather. However, the effect of short-term increases in temperature on campylobacter transmission is, at most, weak, in contrast to that consistently observed with salmonella transmission (Kovats et al. 2004; D’Souza et al. 2004).\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThere is limited person-to-person transmission in infection with campylobacter, and changes in human host susceptibility are unlikely to be important determinants of the seasonal pattern (Dowell 2001). However, intra-annual changes in the animal host reservoirs may be an important explanation for the seasonal patterns.\\n\\nThe timing of seasons is now shifting in the mid to high latitudes due to climate change. The onset of spring events moved forward by, on average, 6.3 days from 1959 to 1996 in Europe (Menzel 2000), and associated changes have been observed in both animal and plant species (Root et al. 2003).\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOur study indicates that climate change is unlikely to significantly affect the seasonal pattern of campylobacteriosis in humans. More specific questions relating to the role of climate variability can be addressed once more detailed information on vehicles or serotyping becomes available.\\n\\nWe recommend that countries develop integrated surveillance systems to monitor pathogens in animals as well as humans (WHO 2004). Currently, there are insufficient data to determine the seasonality or temperature-sensitivity of pathogens in animals and other environmental reservoirs.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nS. H., S.

It has been estimated that globally, bacterial, viral, amoebic and protozoan enteric infections cause 4 billion cases of diarrhoea each year (WHO 2000). In 2002 –2003, the deaths of approximately 1.9 million children under the age of five were attributed to diarrhoea (Bryce et al. 2005). The burden of enteric disease is substantially higher in poor countries, but it is also a significant problem in industrialised countries such as New Zealand (Rose et al. 2000; Crump et al. 2001). Although enteric diseases do not cause significant mortality in developed countries, they do cause considerable discomfort for those infected and some enteric diseases can lead to debilitating, long-term sequelae (Nachamkin et al. 1998).\\n\\nCryptosporidium is a protozoan enteropathogen that has been estimated to cause 2–6% of the global burden of...\\n---\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-indent: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\n# E. Britton et al.\\n\\nJournal of Water and Health | 08.3 | 2010\\n\\nDiarrhoeal disease in immunocompetent people and 14–24% of diarrhoeal disease in those with HIV (Guerrant 1997). The New Zealand cryptosporidiosis notification rate in 2007 was 21.9 per 100,000 population (Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd (ESR) 2008), which is relatively high compared to other developed countries (Snel et al. 2009b). Giardia is another protozoan enteropathogen of significance. According to Hoque et al. (2004) “approximately 200 million people are infected with the parasite (Giardia) globally”. The New Zealand giardiasis notification rate in 2007 was 33.1 per 100,000 population (Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd (ESR) 2008), which is again relatively high compared to other developed countries (Snel et al. 2009a).\\n\\nThe seasonal patterns of cryptosporidiosis (Snel et al. 2009b) and giardiasis (Hoque et al. 2004; Snel et al. 2009a) observed in New Zealand are likely to be due to a combination of factors. In New Zealand, the spring peak in cryptosporidiosis is thought to be due, in part, to the increase in the number of infectious livestock during the spring lambing and calving season (Goldsmid et al. 2003; Lake et al. 2008; Snel et al. 2009b). However, the seasonality of these protozoan diseases raises the possibility that seasonal variation in climatic factors, such as rainfall and temperature, could also be influencing disease rates.\\n\\nOne of the main routes of transmission of Cryptosporidium and Giardia to humans is through water (Rose 1997; Goldsmid et al. 2003). High levels of rainfall onto saturated soil could plausibly facilitate the transfer of Cryptosporidium oocysts in animal manure into surface water (Lake et al. 2005; Thurston-Enriquez et al. 2005). Sewage overflow during high levels of rainfall could also lead to Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts contaminating water used for recreation or drinking (Lake et al. 2005). In several studies, rainfall has been found to be positively correlated with the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts and/or Giardia cysts in surface and runoff water (Atherholt et al. 1998; Thurston-Enriquez et al. 2005; Arnone & Walling 2006; Miller et al. 2007). Water treatment plants may offer some protection against water-borne transmission but they may not be adequate to cope with a substantial increase in pathogens in the water source following heavy rainfall (Curriero et al. 2001; Naumova et al. 2005). The 1993 Milwaukee outbreak of cryptosporidiosis has been attributed to a preceding period of heavy rainfall and runoff that increased the turbidity load and the number of oocysts to levels that the treatment plant could not adequately remove (MacKenzie et al. 1994; Rose et al. 2001).\\n\\nHowever, the link between rainfall and protozoan disease is still controversial in the literature. A positive association was found between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis rates in a study in the North-West region of England (Naumova et al. 2005). According to Naumova et al. (2005) the “overall weekly rate of cryptosporidiosis in the region increases by 27%, (95% CI 21–33%) if the cumulative rainfall for the prior week was at the 75th percentile (or 22 mm)”. In contrast, a study in Brisbane, Australia found no association between rainfall and monthly cryptosporidiosis incidence (Hu et al. 2007). Similarly, Lake et al. (2008) did not find an association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand. However, this study analysed the relationship at the national level using nationally aggregated climate data, which may not have reflected the geographic variation in rainfall exposure in New Zealand. Both Hu et al. (2007) and Lake et al. (2008) found that temperature was positively associated with cryptosporidiosis rates.\\n\\nThe relationship between giardiasis and climate variability has not previously been investigated in New Zealand. Specific international literature on this topic is also limited. In one study, giardiasis was found to be more prevalent in the rainy season in Mexico compared to the dry season (Cifuentes et al. 2004). In another study, in Massachusetts, rates of giardiasis were reported to peak approximately one month after a peak in temperature (Naumova et al. 2007). Positive associations between water-borne disease outbreaks and heavy rainfall events have been found in three other recent studies and giardiasis is one of the most common waterborne diseases (Rose et al. 2000; Curriero et al. 2001; Thomas et al. 2006).'),\n",

Consequently, climate change is likely to affect the transmission of infectious diseases, including water-borne enteric infections (IPCC 2007). Therefore it is particularly important to have a better understanding of these dynamics.\\n---\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-indent: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\n# Authors: E.

The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the spatial relationships between rainfall and ambient temperature and notifications of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in New Zealand over the 10-year period 1997 to 2006.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThe geographical level of analysis chosen for this study was the census area unit (CAU). CAUs are statistically defined areas that are comparable in size and distribution with the other environmental exposures of interest in this analysis.\\n\\n# Outcome Data\\n\\nThe outcomes of interest in this study were the total cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis notification counts during 1997–2006 for each CAU in New Zealand. The geocoded outcome data were obtained from the national notifiable disease surveillance system, provided by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd (ESR).\\n\\n# Exposure Data\\n\\nThe climate data for each CAU were derived from mathematical surfaces fitted to long run average climate station data for New Zealand for the period 1950–1980 (Leathwick et al. 2002b). The variable used in this analysis to represent rainfall was the average annual rainfall to evaporation ratio, which serves as an indicator of runoff into water sources (Leathwick et al. 2002a).\\n\\nNon-climatic factors may also affect the rates of protozoan disease, such as the quality of water treatment (Duncanson et al. 2000; Naumova et al. 2000), socio-economic deprivation (Naumova et al. 2000), and urban-rural status (Snel et al. 2009c). Therefore, the spatial patterns of these environmental factors and their potential influence on the rainfall/protozoan relationship were also examined in this study.\\n\\n# Water Quality Classification\\n\\nTo classify the water quality of each CAU, a simplified version of the New Zealand Ministry of Health water distribution zone grading system was created, using the data for 1996. A water distribution zone is part of a water supply network, within which all consumers should receive drinking water of similar quality. Areas that did not have a reticulated community water supply were referred to as areas with “no water supply”.\\n\\nCAUs were classified as urban or rural, using the version of the Statistics New Zealand urban/rural profile classification system that is based on population density (Statistics New Zealand Aotearoa 2008). A simplified version of the NZDep2001 classification was used to analyze the influence of deprivation.\\n---\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nAuthors: E. Britton et al.\\n\\nJournal: Journal of Water and Health | Volume 8, Issue 3 | Year 2010\\n\\n# Analytic Methods\\n\\nWe imported maps of CAU boundaries, protozoan disease notifications, average temperature, rainfall, water distribution zones, rurality, and socioeconomic deprivation into a Geographic Information System (GIS). Climate and water quality data were summarized within the CAU boundaries and exported to a statistical package for regression analysis. A negative binomial regression model was chosen in order to account for over-dispersion. This model was compared with other count models using the Stata countfit test and was assessed as being the best model for the data. The correlation coefficients between the water supply distribution and source quality grades ranged between 0.62 (poorer quality), 0.83 (unknown quality), and 1 (no community reticulated water supply). The effect of water source quality and water distribution quality had to therefore be analysed in separate models to avoid multicollinearity. Subsequently, for both cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, there were two multivariate regression models created. The source model included variables for the rainfall to evaporation ratio, temperature, and indicator variables for urban/rural, deprivation, and water supply source quality. The distribution model included variables for the rainfall to evaporation ratio, temperature, and indicator variables for urban/rural, deprivation, and water supply distribution quality.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Descriptive Characteristics of CAUs\\n\\nTables 1 and 2 display the sample characteristics of the 1713 CAUs included in the analysis. Missing data meant that 131 (7.1%) CAUs were excluded. However, these CAUs had very small populations or were unpopulated islands or harbours, and so their exclusion was unlikely to affect the overall results. The mean notification count per CAU was 5 for cryptosporidiosis and just under 10 for giardiasis over the 10-year period of interest, with considerable variability between CAUs.\\n\\n# Geographical Analysis\\n\\nInspection of the GIS maps suggested that cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis notifications were more frequent in rural areas and in the South Island. The cryptosporidiosis map is presented in Figure 1. Several areas were also identified that appeared to have high rainfall to evaporation ratios and high levels of protozoan disease notifications. A substantial number of CAUs in New Zealand did not have a reticulated community water supply, and many of the water supplies had poor quality gradings. Many of the areas that did not have the best quality water supply appeared to correspond to areas with high rates of protozoan disease notification.\\n\\n# Regression Analysis\\n\\nThe results of the regression analyses are displayed in Tables 3 and 4.

This was to determine whether the rainfall to evaporation ratio or other variables had a different effect on cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis rates within CAUs with different water source quality or distribution quality. One of the key findings from this analysis was that the effect of rainfall on cryptosporidiosis risk was modified by characteristics of the local water supply. Within CAUs with the best graded water supply source, for every one unit increase in the rainfall to evaporation ratio the cryptosporidiosis rate was predicted to decrease by 0.96 [95% CI 0.939, 0.988]. Among CAUs with no water supply, for a one unit increase in the rainfall to evaporation ratio the cryptosporidiosis rate was predicted to increase by 1.02 [95% CI 1.009, 1.025]. There was no significant variation in the effect of rainfall across categories of water source for giardiasis.\\n\\nThe effect of interaction between the rainfall to evaporation ratio and water supply quality on giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis rates was also tested in subsequent models. However, the results were not used in this analysis as the inclusion of this interaction doubled to quadrupled the standard errors, indicating multicollinearity.\\n---\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nAuthors: E.

This association was found to be significant in the unadjusted univariate analysis and remained significant after adjusting for temperature, rurality, deprivation, and water supply grading. This result is consistent with the findings of Naumova et al. (2005) in North West England. However, a previous study did not find an association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand (Lake et al. 2008). That study analyzed the temporal relationship at the national level, so could not take into account the geographic variation in climate occurring at the much finer CAU level of analysis we have reported here.\\n\\nThe negative association between temperature and cryptosporidiosis was significant in both univariate and multivariate analyses, suggesting that a higher mean ambient temperature could be protective against cryptosporidiosis. This result is consistent with the laboratory findings of Ives et al. (2007) who demonstrated that higher temperatures were associated with increased rates of inactivation of cryptosporidiosis (comparing temperatures of 30°C, 22°C, and 5°C). However, Hu et al. (2007) and Lake et al. (2008) found positive temporal associations between temperature and cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nUrban/rural status was a strong predictor of cryptosporidiosis in both the univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Similar results have previously been found in a geographical analysis of cryptosporidiosis rates in New Zealand (Snel et al. 2009b). However, the urban/rural classification was not significantly associated with giardiasis in the multivariate analysis, a finding which is also consistent with previous New Zealand analyses (Snel et al. 2009a). The differences in results between these two protozoan diseases might be explained by differences in transmission pathways. Cryptosporidiosis can be transmitted by infected animals such as cattle and sheep (zoonotic), whereas giardiasis is more likely to be transmitted by an infected human or by human sewage (anthroponotic) (Heymann 2004; Snel et al. 2009a,b,c). This difference in the relative importance of human and animal reservoirs may explain why rurality is associated with higher cryptosporidiosis rates but not giardiasis rates.\\n---\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Climate Variability and Protozoan Disease\\n\\n# E.

Britton et al.\\n\\nJournal of Water and Health | 08.3 | 2010\\n\\nThe finding, that CAUs classified as socioeconomically advantaged had higher rates of notified cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, is similar to the results of a previous geographical analysis of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis rates in New Zealand (Snel et al. 2009a,b,c). This finding could suggest that living in a socioeconomically deprived CAU is a protective factor against cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. However, the use of notification data may be less likely to identify cases of disease in deprived areas, because the population in these areas may be less likely to access health care and laboratory testing services when they have a diarrhoeal illness (for a variety of reasons including transport barriers). Previous analyses of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis found that people hospitalised with these diseases showed the more familiar gradient of higher rates for those from the socioeconomically deprived areas (Snel et al. 2009a,b).\\n\\nCAUs with no reticulated community water supply were found to have higher rates of both cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis compared with the CAUs with the best quality water supply, in both the univariate and multivariate models. This association was stronger for cryptosporidiosis than giardiasis and was not significant in the giardiasis distribution model. Within the CAUs that had the best quality water supply source, an increase in the rainfall to evaporation ratio was associated with a significantly reduced rate of cryptosporidiosis. This finding suggests that the CAUs with the best quality water supply source are better protected against the effects of rainfall on rates of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nCAUs with poorer quality water supply sources had significantly higher rates of cryptosporidiosis compared to CAUs with water supplies that had the best quality source. However, in both univariate and multivariate analysis, water supplies with poorer quality distribution had significantly lower rates of giardiasis notifications compared to CAUs with the best quality water supply distribution. This is a counter-intuitive result, which is difficult to explain. However, it may potentially be due to reporting bias. Areas with the best quality water may also be areas where the population may have better access to health care and subsequently may have higher notification rates (although, this is not the pattern seen for cryptosporidiosis).\\n\\n# Limitations and Strengths\\n\\nNotification data were used to identify those with the outcome of interest and this inevitably underestimated disease occurrence in the community. This source of data only includes those who sought medical attention from a doctor, were investigated using the correct laboratory tests, and who were subsequently notified to the medical officer of health. The reporting pyramid means that only a small fraction of community cases of enteric disease are ultimately reported to national surveillance agencies (Wheeler et al. 1999). These surveillance effects could have biased the results as they are likely to vary between areas of New Zealand. They could also have contributed systematic underestimation of disease rates within the more deprived or more rural CAUs due to the cost or accessibility of health care. Spatial autocorrelation was not adjusted for in the analysis so there is the potential that this may have affected the estimation of the standard errors.\\n\\nA strength of this study was that it analysed environmental exposures with outcomes at the CAU level, instead of the national level, which enabled it to take into account the geographic variation in exposures across New Zealand. However, it is important to note that even at this more homogenous level, aggregated data may not accurately describe individual exposure, (ecological fallacy) (Beale et al. 2008). Additionally, in analysing spatial data, changes in the size and shape of the areal units used could affect the analysis (Modifiable Areal Unit Problem) (Beale et al. 2008). Misclassification of exposure could have occurred due to the CAU being incorrectly recorded in the notification data, which has been found to be an issue especially in rural areas (Skelly et al. 2002). The climate data did not cover the specific time period of the disease outcome data. However, the climate data used were derived from thirty years of data for each CAU, so is likely to represent an accurate picture of the spatial pattern of exposure within CAUs.\\n\\n# Confounding\\n\\nIt was not possible to control for all potential confounders at the population level.

Britton et al.\\n\\nJournal: Journal of Water and Health | Volume 8, Issue 3 | Year 2010\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nA key strength of this study is that the associations are based on long-term observations, which increases the applicability of the results to the gradual effects of climate change. Global climate change is projected to increase the amount of rainfall in the western and southern parts of New Zealand, with an increase in the frequency of heavy rainfall in the west (Hennessy et al. 2007). Therefore, if the associations found in this study are causal, other things being equal, this study suggests that CAUs in these areas may experience increased rates of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis due to climate change. However, CAUs with higher average temperatures had reduced rates of cryptosporidiosis and temperature is projected to increase due to climate change (Hennessy et al. 2007). Therefore these results suggest that the overall effect of climate change on cryptosporidiosis notifications may follow a complex spatial pattern in New Zealand, as the projected increase in temperature and increase in rainfall may have opposing effects.\\n\\nRural CAUs and CAUs that do not have a water supply were found in this study to have higher rates of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis notifications. The results of this study also suggest that having the best quality water supply could be protective against the effects of increased rainfall on rates of cryptosporidiosis at the CAU level. These findings have implications for public health planning and climate change adaptation strategies. They suggest that improving CAU water supply quality in New Zealand, especially in rural areas, could be a method of reducing vulnerability to the impact of climate change on protozoan diseases. Even without the effects of climate change, our findings provide support for increasing the provision of community reticulated water supplies as a strategy to lower rates of these enteric diseases.\\n\\n# Ethics Approval\\n\\nThe study protocol was approved by the Multi-region Ethics Committee, Ministry of Health, Wellington, New Zealand, which is constituted and operates in accordance with the Operational Standard for Ethics Committees, on May 1, 2008.

To better understand any potential impact of warmer temperature on enteric infections in Canada, we investigated the relationship between ambient temperature and weekly reports of confirmed cases of three pathogens in Canada: Salmonella, pathogenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter, between 1992 and 2000 in two Canadian provinces. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) to estimate the effect of seasonal adjustments on the estimated models. We found a strong non-linear association between ambient temperature and the occurrence of all three enteric pathogens in Alberta, Canada, and of Campylobacter in Newfoundland-Labrador. Threshold models were used to quantify the relationship of disease and temperature with thresholds chosen from 0 to −10°C depending on the pathogen modeled. For Alberta, the log relative risk of Salmonella weekly case counts increased by 1.2%, Campylobacter weekly case counts increased by 2.2%, and E. coli weekly case counts increased by 6.0% for every degree increase in weekly mean temperature. For Newfoundland-Labrador, the log relative risk increased by 4.5% for Campylobacter for every degree increase in weekly mean temperature.\\n\\n# Authors' Affiliations\\n\\nManon Fleury (*) and Dominique F.

Every person is at risk of foodborne diseases. In Canada, the most commonly reported bacterial enteric pathogens are Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli. These pathogens are generally foodborne in Canada (Canadian Integrated Surveillance Report 2003). Advances in food protection have not resolved all public health concerns about foodborne infections, even in developed countries. While most foodborne diseases occur sporadically and are often not reported, foodborne disease outbreaks can take on massive magnitudes. For example, in 1998, an outbreak of Salmonella due to contaminated cheese occurred in Canada, affecting approximately 800 people (Canadian Medical Association Journal 2003).\\n\\nA number of studies have shown an effect of ambient temperature on the occurrence of certain enteric diseases. A study exploring growth rates of salmonellosis under varying temperatures found that the growth rate increased as the temperature increased (Mackey and Kerridge 1988). It has been noted that enteric diseases in temperate latitudes have a seasonal pattern, with the highest incidence of illness during the summer months (Isaacs et al. 1998). A study of foodborne illness in the United Kingdom found a relationship between the incidence of disease and the temperature in the month preceding the illness (Bentham and Langford 2001). It is believed that the survival and growth of certain enteric pathogens are, within limits, positively correlated with ambient temperature (Hall et al. 2002). In a study of five cities in Australia, D’Souza et al. (2004) found a significant positive association between mean temperature in the previous month and the number of notifications of cases of Salmonella in the current month.

Warmer ambient temperatures, combined with changes in eating behavior, may contribute to the rise in foodborne enteric diseases.\\n\\n# Objective\\n\\nThe objective of this study was to explore the relationship between the weekly occurrence of enteric bacterial disease notifications and short-term variations in ambient temperature, while adjusting for seasonal effects and long-term trends.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nAll Canadian provinces were approached for participation. However, due to constraints in time, resources, and data availability, only Alberta and Newfoundland-Labrador were included in the study. Alberta has a population of approximately 2,696,826, while Newfoundland-Labrador has about 551,792 (Statistics Canada 2002).\\n\\nAlberta is characterized by dry and warm summers and cold winters, whereas Newfoundland-Labrador experiences moderate to cool wet summers and milder winters due to coastal effects (Environment Canada 2002).\\n\\nWeekly laboratory-confirmed cases of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and entero-pathogenic E. coli were collected from the Notifiable Disease Registries (NDR) for both provinces. Temperature data were obtained from 92 weather stations in Alberta and 59 in Newfoundland-Labrador, covering the period from January 1992 to December 2000.\\n\\nThe NDR observations included 6,282 cases of Salmonella, 1,743 cases of Campylobacter, and 9,664 cases of E. coli in Alberta, and 986 cases of Salmonella and 1,188 cases of Campylobacter in Newfoundland-Labrador.\\n\\nData were geographically identified by health region, with 17 regions in Alberta and 6 in Newfoundland-Labrador. To address data scarcity, health regions were grouped according to climate zones.\\n\\nGeneralized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM) were employed to analyze the data, accommodating the non-normality and heteroscedasticity typical of count data. Both models were included due to ongoing debates regarding the use of GAM in air pollution literature (Dominici et al. 2002).\\n\\nFig. 1: Map of Canada highlighting the two study provinces, Alberta and Newfoundland-Labrador\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Temperature and Enteric Disease\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nSpline and loess smoothers were included in the model to control for any confounding effect of season, and to ward against any masking short-term effects of temperature on enteric disease, choosing degrees of freedom (df) and spans that minimize Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and the sum of the absolute partial autocorrelations (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990).

Generalized cross-validation and Dominici’s (Dominici et al. 2002) sensitivity parameter were used as additional criteria for selection of the loess span. We chose a span of 0.025 (12 weeks) for the loess smoother and an average df of 73 (corresponding to 6.5 weeks per df) for the B-spline. In addition to the B-spline, a categorical variable (season) provided additional control of seasonal confounding in the GLM model.\\n\\nTo explore the shape of the relationship between temperature and disease case counts, after accounting for the potential confounding effects of seasonal and holiday variation, temperature was modelled using a loess smoother with a smoothing window of 15°C for the GAM model and a B-spline with a smoothing window of 15°C for the GLM model. Average weekly temperature lagged by 0–6 weeks prior to the incidence of weekly disease case counts was modeled separately in the model.\\n\\nEnteric disease counts are typically highly correlated from week to week. This may result from the existence of local contagion, seasonal effects, or other unmeasured effects. Therefore, transitional regression models, with lagged outcome variables and residuals from prior days included as covariates, were included in the models to see if serial-correlation appeared in the partial autocorrelation plots (Brumback et al. 2000). All analyses were conducted using S-Plus 2000 (Mathsoft 1999).\\n\\nA delayed effect of temperature on foodborne illness (Bentham and Langford 1995) was addressed by lagging the mean weekly temperature by between 0 and 6 weeks. Two variables were incorporated variously into the regression model in order to model temporal trends of enteric illness: an index variable labelled “Week,” identified weeks beginning 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2000; a second categorical variable, “Season,” classified data by winter (December, January and February), spring (March, April and May), summer (June, July and August) and fall (September, October and November). Prior research has found that major holidays affect the reporting of enteric diseases in Canada (Aramini et al. 2000). Hence a categorical variable was included to allow for differing effects of Canadian statutory holidays. Climate zone health region groups were incorporated as a categorical variable to control for variation in population size, and other characteristics associated with each health region and regional climate.\\n\\nAlthough it would have been preferable to control for records of cases of disease linked to known outbreaks, such information on outbreaks was available only from 1998 to 2000. Exclusion of these records would artificially inflate case counts of illness prior to 1998. In the analysis of the Salmonella case counts in Alberta, a test for residual outliers identified three influential points. These were down-weighted in the model since these inflated weekly counts were clearly attributable to outbreaks.\\n\\nSince the smoothed models suggested a piecewise linear effect of temperature on log mean case counts and because the biology of enteric disease suggests a meaningful change in the behaviour of pathogens at certain temperatures, threshold models were also considered. These allowed for no effect of temperature up to a certain temperature and a linear effect above this point (Ulm and Salanti 2003). Exploratory modeling and deviance tests of temperature effects for each pathogen suggested one or two cut-off points. Likelihood (deviance)-based confidence intervals were then constructed for these apparent thresholds. With these in hand, cut-off points were incorporated into the models for each of the pathogens in each of the provinces.\\n\\nFor all models, the selection methods included comparing nested models using the likelihood ratio test (deviance test) as well as the AIC. The final log-linear GAM and log-linear GLM were:\\n\\n# GAM\\n\\nlog(Counts) = loess(Temperature(lag 0-6 weeks); span = 15 degrees Celsius) + factor(Holiday) + Lagged Count + factor(Health Region Group) + loess(Week; span = 12 weeks)\\n\\n# GLM\\n\\nlog(Counts) = bs(Temperature(lag 0-6 weeks); df = 15 degrees Celsius) + factor(Holiday) + Lagged Count + factor(Health Region Group) + bs(Week; df = 6.5 weeks) + factor(Season)\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nFigures 2 and 3 show plots of weekly incidence of infection, from 1992 to 2000, for pathogens Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli in Alberta, and Salmonella, and Campylobacter in Newfoundland-Labrador, respectively. Peaks were evident in early summer and the large spikes that appear outside the regular seasonal trend may correspond to unidentified outbreaks of disease. Some of the large spikes were down-weighted by averaging the days before and after this value, because they masked the seasonal pattern. Figures 4 and 5 show seasonal patterns averaged across the 9 years of data. Similar seasonal patterns were seen for the three pathogens and for temperature.\\n\\nAverage weekly temperatures from 0 to 6 weeks prior to the incidence of weekly disease were found to be significant for all pathogens in each location. The temperature 1 week prior to illness was selected as the best fitting lag, according to the AIC.

The log-relative risk plots indicate a linear relationship beyond this threshold, highlighting the importance of temperature in predicting disease outbreaks.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis study underscores the need for public health interventions that consider temperature fluctuations as a risk factor for foodborne diseases.

Other variables controlled in the model were holidays and health region group. An autoregressive term was included to control for residual autocorrelation in the model, which is typical of time series data. Our results are consistent with research carried out by Bentham and Langford (1995, 2001), D’Souza et al. (2004), and Kovats et al. (2004).\\n\\nBentham and Langford (2001) modeled lagged temperature and enteric bacterial notifications and found a strong association of foodborne illness with temperatures 2–5 weeks earlier, which could be due to factors occurring earlier in the food production system. We found an association between temperature and disease when looking at lags from 0–6 weeks prior to disease. All these lags had strong predictive effects on the incidence of illness for Alberta and Newfoundland-Labrador. This suggests that temperature may affect contamination at any point along the food chain, including the farm, the processing plant, or the home (Hall et al. 2002), and thus have an impact on the risk of disease, and may also indicate a need for more precise modelling of any lag effects of temperature on disease risk.\\n\\nTo verify the models for any spurious significance of lag effects, temperature data lagged after disease events were modelled, and found not to be significantly associated with outcome, unlike temperature prior to disease events. Threshold models were helpful in estimating the risk of enteric illness associated with temperature above a temperature threshold. These thresholds were generally compatible with nonparametric models, which suggested a linear relationship after a certain threshold. The thresholds were estimated for each of the pathogens and suggested a relative risk increase with temperature above the threshold for all modeled pathogens in both provinces.\\n\\nThe association between temperature and risk of salmonellosis in Newfoundland-Labrador differed from the results of the other pathogens in our study. There are several possible explanations for this difference in results. It may be that the risk of salmonellosis may truly not be associated with increased temperature in Newfoundland-Labrador. However, international evidence for an effect of temperature on Salmonella, and the results from Campylobacter in Newfoundland-Labrador suggest otherwise. We feel that there may be some unmeasured causes of Salmonella in Newfoundland-Labrador that are confounding the effect of temperature. Such unmeasured factors may include cases linked to point-source outbreaks, cases linked to travel outside of Newfoundland-Labrador, and cases linked to food behaviours in rural and northern parts of the province, where fish is consumed more than other meats, therefore reducing the risk of exposure to Salmonella.\\n\\nFinally, the analysis has been hampered by a lack of power, given the smaller number of cases of this disease in the province (n=986). Despite the fact that outbreak data could not consistently be differentiated from other sporadic cases, residual confounding and bias did not appear to be an issue. We successfully identified only three influential points in Alberta for Salmonella points using a residual test for.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Bacterial Enteric Disease Risk\\n\\n# Figure 6: Smoothed Plots for Temperature vs. Bacterial Pathogens\\n\\nLog-relative risk of Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli for Alberta (AB) and Newfoundland-Labrador (NFLD-LAB) versus temperature lagged 1 week.\\n\\nOur approach proved that the loess smoother in GAM was sufficient to control for seasonal variation in the model, whereas GLM needed an extra seasonal parameter, “Season.” This could be due to parametric splines used in the model not allowing for adequate control of seasonal confounding.\\n\\nSome caution is required when applying GAM and GLM to enteric disease data.

It is known that many pathogens in the environment are sensitive to ambient temperature. Given global climate change and projections for warmer summers, an increase in cases of foodborne illness may be expected.\\n\\nAlthough some trends in enteric disease infections are decreasing, public health authorities may want to take action and focus public education programs and other policies to particularly vulnerable groups and to relevant occupational groups in the short term, and may consider new policies in anticipation of additional cases of foodborne disease due to climate change.\\n\\n# Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) Values\\n\\n|Province|Pathogen|B-spline GLM|Threshold GLM|Loess GAM|Threshold GAM|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Alberta|Salmonella|4,137.8|4,143.7|4,119.9|4,363.6|\\n|Alberta|Campylobacter|4,440.5|4,445.2|4,428.0|4,679.4|\\n|Alberta|E. coli|2,878.7|2,882.8|2,856.3|3,062.3|\\n|Newfoundland-Labrador|Salmonella|789.8|789.1|802.7|911.7|\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\nmargin-bottom: 5px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nmargin-bottom: 5px;\\n}\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank Alberta Public Health and Newfoundland and Labrador Centre for Health Information for the use of their notifiable disease data for this study.

We investigated the relationships between hospital visits for rotavirus diarrhoea and temperature, humidity and river level, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using time-series analysis adjusting for other confounding seasonal factors. There was strong evidence for an increase in rotavirus diarrhoea at high temperatures, by 40.2% for each 1°C increase above a threshold (29°C). Relative humidity had a linear inverse relationship with the number of cases of rotavirus diarrhoea. River level, above a threshold (4.8 m), was associated with an increase in cases of rotavirus diarrhoea, by 5.5% per 10-cm river-level rise. Our findings provide evidence that factors associated with high temperature, low humidity and high river-level increase the incidence of rotavirus diarrhoea in Dhaka.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus remains the leading cause of childhood diarrhoea worldwide. About 40% of the hospitalizations for childhood diarrhoea worldwide are attributable to rotavirus and more than 0.6 million children aged <5 years die every year from rotavirus infection, mainly in developing countries. Rotavirus diarrhoea peaks in winter and is rarely identified in summer in temperate regions, for example, the United States, Japan, northern Asian regions, temperate regions in Australia and Europe.\\n\\nBy contrast, it is detected all year round with less obvious seasonality in the tropics, for example, in Bangladesh, southern Asian regions, Bahrain and Costa Rica. A study using data from 34 studies from 23 countries on six continents showed that the seasonality of rotavirus diarrhoea is less distinct in the areas within 10° of latitude from the equator.\\n\\nAttempts to explain these findings have been made by relating disease incidence to climate factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall, but no clear conclusions could be drawn. In Japan, Konno et al. reported that rotavirus infection was associated with lower temperature, but not with relative humidity. In the United States, rotavirus hospitalizations were more common after cold or dry (small amount of rainfall) months than after warm or wet months.\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: Dr M.

However, previous studies inferred this relationship from the increased number of rotavirus infections during cold or dry months, which may be a consequence of other environmental or behavioral factors. Potential mutual confounding between weather factors, such as temperature and humidity, has not been adequately considered. In Bangladesh, high river levels have been suggested as an explanation for a seasonal peak in rotavirus infections during the monsoon.\\n\\nIn this study, we investigated the relationship between short-term variations in ambient temperature, relative humidity, and river level, and the number of hospital visits due to rotavirus infections in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using time-series methodology that controls for mutual confounding and seasonal patterns of unknown cause.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThe primary outcome in this study is the weekly number of patients with rotavirus diarrhoea visiting the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) Dhaka Hospital. The ICDDR,B Hospital serves an urban population of about 10 million individuals and provides free treatment to more than 100,000 patients with diarrhoea each year. Since 1996, every 50th patient attending the hospital for treatment of diarrhoea was enrolled in the surveillance system. For all patients enrolled, faecal samples were collected and tested for rotavirus antigen by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay modeled after the Dakopatts commercial kit (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark).\\n\\nWe abstracted individual information on the date of hospital visit and the pathogens identified from each stool specimen during a 6-year period (January 1996 to December 2001). A patient was classified as having rotavirus diarrhoea when rotavirus antigen was identified in the stool specimen. Cases where V. cholerae was identified simultaneously were excluded from the analysis (n=199, 6% of all rotavirus-positive patients).\\n\\nDaily maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity in Dhaka were obtained from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Daily average temperatures were computed as the mean of the daily maximum and minimum values. The daily river level of the Brigonga River at Mill Barrack in Dhaka was recorded by the Bangladesh Water Development Board. The weekly means for average temperature, relative humidity, and river level were calculated from the daily records.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nWe examined the relationships between the weekly number of rotavirus diarrhoea cases and temperature, relative humidity, and river level, using generalized linear Poisson regression models allowing for overdispersion. To account for seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhoea not directly due to these weather factors, Fourier terms with annual periodicity, up to the sixth harmonic, were introduced into the model. These are sine-cosine pairs, which together can fit any smooth pattern repeated each year.\\n\\nIndicator variables for the years of the study were incorporated into the model to allow for long-term trends and other variations between years. After adjusting for these seasonal patterns and between-year variations, the short-term associations between climate variables and the number of rotavirus diarrhoea cases were investigated. An indicator variable for public holidays was included to account for an artificial drop in hospital visits during these weeks. Rainfall was initially considered but was not included in the final analysis due to lack of evidence of association with rotavirus diarrhoea cases.\\n\\nTo allow for autocorrelations, an autoregressive term at order 1 was incorporated into the models. We considered lags (delays in effect) of up to 4 weeks based on previous studies. In initial analyses, natural cubic splines (3 D.F.) were fitted to means over lags of 0–4 weeks for mean temperature, relative humidity, and river level. All three splines were included simultaneously in the model to control for potential mutual confounding.\\n\\nIn summary, the model took the following form:\\n\\nlog [E(Y)]=a+NS(temp0 – 4, 3 D:F:)+NS(hum0 – 4, 3 D:F:)+NS(river0 – 4, 3 D:F:)+time(Fourier, 6 harmonics=year)+i:year+i:holiday\\n\\nwhere E(Y) is the expected weekly case count, ‘temp’, ‘hum’, and ‘river’ indicate average weekly temperature, relative humidity, and river level, respectively.

The choice of threshold was based on maximum-likelihood estimation for the temperature or river level over a grid of all possible integer values within a range indicated on the weather–rotavirus diarrhoea graphs.\\nLikelihood profile confidence intervals (CIs) for each threshold were calculated as the thresholds for which deviance of the model was 3.84 more than the minimum.\\nBecause the plots of the smoothed relationships with humidity suggested a broadly linear negative relationship, we fitted a linear model to estimate the effect (slope).\\nWith the simple linear model, we examined lag effects in more detail by fitting linear unconstrained distributed lag models, comprising terms for humidity, temperature, and river level at each lag from 0 to 4 weeks.\\nThe simple linear-threshold model also allowed investigation of the modification of the effect of temperature, humidity, and river level between seasons by including interaction terms in the models.\\nThe likelihood ratio test was used to test the evidence for the interaction. The season was categorized as summer (March–May), monsoon (June–September), or winter (October–February).\\n\\nTo investigate whether the results were sensitive to the levels of control for seasonal patterns, the analyses were repeated using Fourier terms up to the 3rd and 12th harmonics per year.\\nAll statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 9.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nOut of 13,983 hospital visits (one in every 50) for all cause diarrhoea from 1996 to 2001, there were 3,115 rotavirus diarrhoea cases, of which 62.5% were in children aged 2 years.\\nMales (60.4%) were more numerous than females (39.3%).

Percent change shows the change in the number of cases for every 1 °C increase above the threshold (29 °C).\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\nIn the crude relationship, there appeared to be an increase in the number of cases of rotavirus diarrhoea when the river level was higher than 4–5 m. This pattern was similar (with slight loss of precision) after adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, seasonal patterns, between-year variations, and public holidays. The estimated threshold was 4.8 m (95% CI 4.2–5.1). For each 10-cm increase above the threshold, the number of hospital visits for rotavirus diarrhoea increased by 5.5 % (95 % CI 3.2–7.8). The distributed lag model showed that there was suggestive evidence for an effect of river level at lag 1, while little effect was observed for any of the other lags.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nIn Bangladesh, there appears to be a significant positive association between the number of hospital visits for rotavirus diarrhoea and temperature above a threshold after adjusting for potential confounding by humidity, river level, seasonal patterns, between-year variations, and public holidays. An inverse association between relative humidity and the number of rotavirus infections was also observed. Higher river level was associated with increased risk of rotavirus infections independently of these weather factors.\\n\\nThere have been many reports that have attempted to identify an association between the incidence of rotavirus infections and weather factors. In temperate regions, a peak in rotavirus infections is observed in the colder and drier months of the year. In tropical and subtropical settings as well, the peak of rotavirus infections occurs in cool dry seasons, although the seasonality is less obvious in some developing countries. Therefore, lower air temperature, especially in combination with a dry atmosphere, has been suggested to increase the number of rotavirus infections.\\n\\nHowever, previous studies did not take into account potential confounding due to seasonally varying factors other than weather factors, or mutual confounding between weather factors, which are likely to vary between regions. For example, Konno et al. reported that there was a higher number of rotavirus diarrhoea cases in the months of low temperature in winter, but no association was found with relative humidity in Yamagata, Japan. The discrepancy in the results of association with low temperature could be due to the effect of seasonally varying factors, which was controlled in the current study but not in previous studies.\\n\\nThe possibility that previous observations may be confounded is supported by the results in this study unadjusted for seasonal patterns, which found a significant negative association between temperature and the number of cases. Similarly, in the unadjusted analysis, no association was found between humidity and the number of cases, but a negative association appeared after adjusting for seasonal patterns.\\n\\nThe seasonal pattern of rotavirus diarrhoea cases may be a consequence of unmeasured factors apart from weather factors. These factors include seasonal patterns linked to human activity and environmental factors other than weather. In Washington, DC, more children were hospitalized for rotavirus gastroenteritis after a month of cold or dry weather than after a matched calendar month of warm or wet weather. In that study, temperature and humidity were not mutually adjusted, and this could also be a reason for the discrepancy between the results in Washington and those of this study.\\n\\nThe absence of evidence in this study for a link between low temperature and increasing number of rotavirus diarrhoea cases contrasts with findings from other studies.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Diarrhoea and Humidity\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.graph {\\ndisplay: flex;\\njustify-content: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.graph img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Diarrhoea and Humidity\\n\\n# Figures and Analysis\\n\\nFig. 4.

The effect of temperature may be exerted through complex temperature-dependent pathways in the monsoon season. Further research using the same approach in different climate conditions, for example, in temperate regions, could contribute deeper insight into the effects of temperature.\\n\\nThe finding of a negative association between cases of rotavirus diarrhoea and humidity is more consistent with laboratory evidence. Relative humidity may affect the survival of rotaviruses in air and on fomites and environmental surfaces. At low or medium relative humidity (13–55 %), human rotavirus can remain viable on plastic, glass, and stainless steel for more than 10 days at room temperature. Raising the relative humidity to 80 % results in a rapid loss of infectivity. Survival of human rotavirus in air at 20 °C was best at 50 % relative humidity, with a half-life of 44 h; at low (30%) and high (80%) relative humidity, the half-life was decreased to 24.4 h and 38 h, respectively.\\n\\nFig. 5.

The biological plausibility of a potential high temperature effect and its lag structure (significant at lags 0 and 3 weeks) is not clear. As the most high-temperature weeks are concentrated during the monsoon season, and as we observe an inverse association between relative humidity and the number of rotavirus infections, further investigation is warranted.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Infections and Climate Variability\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 10px;\\n}\\n.graph {\\ndisplay: flex;\\njustify-content: space-around;\\n}\\n.graph div {\\nwidth: 45%;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Infections and Climate Variability\\n\\n# Figure 6\\n\\nRelationship between relative risk (RR) of rotavirus diarrhoea (scaled against the mean weekly number of rotavirus diarrhoea) and average river level over lags of 0–4 weeks (shown as a 3 D.F. natural cubic spline).\\n\\n(a) Crude relationship\\n\\n(b) Relationship adjusted for humidity, temperature, seasonal patterns, between-year variations and public holidays.\\n\\nThe centre line in each graph shows the estimated spline curve, and the upper and lower lines represent the 95% confidence limits.\\n\\n# Figure 7\\n\\nPercent change (and 95% CIs) for high river-level effects of varying periods of risks on rotavirus diarrhoea (unconstrained distributed lag models).\\n\\nPercent change shows the change in the number of cases for every 10 cm increase above the threshold (4.8 m).\\n\\nThe independent effect of high river level on the increased risk of rotavirus infections could be due to exposure to flood water.

Simian rotavirus SA-11 was shown to survive in experimentally contaminated fresh and estuarine waters for several days at 20°C, especially in water heavily polluted with sewage. Studies with rotavirus isolated from humans showed survival for several weeks at either 20°C or 4°C in river water. Infectious particles of rotavirus have been recovered from a variety of natural waters including rivers, lakes, and groundwater. The results of this study support the idea that water or factors associated with river level could have been a frequent transmission route of rotavirus in Bangladesh.\\n\\nClarifying the effects of climate on the spread of rotavirus diarrhoea could contribute to improvements in the precision of the WHO's estimates for diarrhoeal disease burden attributable to global climate change, which did not consider the relative contribution of different pathogens to overall diarrhoea incidence despite the fact that their climate sensitivities are likely to be different.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus and Climate Change\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.acknowledgements, .declaration, .references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder: 1px solid #ccc;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus and Climate Change\\n\\nHospitalized diarrhoea varies from 24% to 45% between world regions [5, 38–40], the results could also improve estimates of regional health risks due to diarrhoeal disease associated with global climate change.\\n\\nA strength of this dataset is the relative completeness of coverage of the population in Dhaka. The hospital serves an urban population of about 10 million individuals and provides free treatment to more than 100,000 cases of diarrhoea each year. Therefore, the data used in this study are reasonably representative of the underlying severe diarrhoeal morbidity of the population in Dhaka. Less severe cases would be less likely to be included, but this does not pose a threat to the validity of the comparisons over time, which is the subject of this study.\\n\\nHowever, this study is not free from biases. Although cases excluded because the stool sample also included V. cholerae were most likely to have attended the hospital because of the cholera, those that would have attended in the absence of cholera should have been included. It was impossible to identify these cases, however, and the total of such comorbidity was small. There is also the possibility of residual confounding, although the robustness of the results to varying degrees of seasonal control was reassuring.\\n\\nThere are important uncertainties related to the extrapolation of the relationships in this study to others with different climate and geography. In particular, the observed association between river level and the number of rotavirus infections may be specific to places characterized by low land with bodies of water that are vulnerable to flooding. The association may also be greatly dependent on the degree of hygiene and sanitation in an area. Therefore, these findings may not pertain to other places.\\n\\nIn this study, weather factors were found to explain departures of the number of rotavirus diarrhoea cases from the usual seasonal pattern. This does not mean that these factors can explain the usual seasonal patterns themselves. The transmission of rotavirus is complex and multifactorial, involving both host and environmental factors. Some of these environmental factors have not been considered in this study, which suggests that temperature, relative humidity and river level might be important environmental determinants of rotavirus infectivity. Further work to clarify the role of weather in the seasonality of rotavirus infections in Bangladesh and elsewhere would be of interest.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the ICDDR,B.

In this study, we used national surveillance data to analyse the relationship between climate and campylobacteriosis in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden and estimate the impact of climate changes on future disease patterns. We show that Campylobacter incidences are linked to increases in temperature and especially precipitation in the week before illness, suggesting a non-food transmission route. These four countries may experience a doubling of Campylobacter cases by the end of the 2080s, corresponding to around 6,000 excess cases per year caused only by climate changes. Considering the strong worldwide burden of campylobacteriosis, it is important to assess local and regional impacts of climate change in order to initiate timely public health management and adaptation strategies.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThe zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter is the most commonly reported cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis throughout Europe, including the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden). Since 2008, the reported incidence of Campylobacter infections in Europe has increased and is now three times greater than that of salmonellosis. Domestic cases of campylobacteriosis are commonly linked to consumption of contaminated food or drink such as poultry, unpasteurized milk, and cross-contaminated vegetables. Lately, environmental and behavioural factors such as recreational water contact, occupational exposure (e.g., poultry farms and abattoirs), and contact with household pets have also emerged as important Campylobacter transmission routes. Infection rates are highest in children under five and young adults, and in all temperate regions, particularly the Nordic countries, the incidence of disease varies seasonally and tends to peak during the late spring and summer months. This peak may represent a combination of fluctuating infection rates in poultry and increased human exposure to environmental reservoirs as well as different eating and hygiene patterns during the summer months.\\n\\n# Climate Change and Infectious Diseases\\n\\nGlobal climate change is predicted to alter temperatures and precipitation across the world with strong direct and indirect impacts on human health. Because weather and climate are important determinants of infectious diseases, including food-borne, it is relevant and important to estimate future changes in disease patterns related to climate or environmental changes. Many published reports highlight a strong effect of climate changes on important infectious diseases such as malaria, West Nile virus, cholera, and tuberculosis, but the impact of climate changes on zoonotic diseases has been less well studied. For instance, it is predicted that climate changes are likely to increase the future incidence of salmonellosis in selected areas, but evidence of a link between climate and Campylobacter is conflicting.\\n\\n1 Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.\\n\\n2 Department of Health Security, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.\\n\\n3 Department of Monitoring and Evaluation, Public Health Agency of Sweden, Solna, Sweden.\\n\\n4 Section for Geography, IGN, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\\n\\n5 Weather and Climate Change Impact Research, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland.\\n\\n6 Department of Hydrology, Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, Oslo, Norway.\\n\\n7 Global Health Section, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\\n\\n*Email: kuh@ssi.dk\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter and Climate\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper: The Impact of Climate on Campylobacter Incidence\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports\\n\\n# Table 1: Models for the Relationship Between Weather and Variations in Campylobacter Cases\\n\\n|Variable|Coefficient|95% CI|p|Overall Statistics|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Summer Period Model (April–September)|Summer Period Model (April–September)|Summer Period Model (April–September)|Summer Period Model (April–September)|Summer Period Model (April–September)| | | | |\\n|Temperature|0.09|0.09–0.10|&lt; 0.001|N. obs = 78,842; X² = 24,036; p &lt; 0.001; R² = 0.51|\\n|Precipitation|0.30|0.29–0.32|&lt; 0.001| |\\n|Heat Wave|−0.10|−0.15 to −0.05|&lt; 0.001| |\\n|Heavy Precipitation|0.79|0.76–0.82|&lt; 0.001| |\\n|Winter Period Model (October–May)|Winter Period Model (October–May)|Winter Period Model (October–May)|Winter Period Model (October–May)|Winter Period Model (October–May)| | | | |\\n|Temperature|0.18|0.17–0.18|&lt; 0.001|N. obs = 66,648; X² = 18,235; p &lt; 0.001; R² = 0.33|\\n|Precipitation|−0.18|−0.19 to −0.18|&lt; 0.001| |\\n|Heavy Precipitation|−0.05|−0.07 to −0.03|&lt; 0.001| |\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nHuman campylobacteriosis is influenced by a complex mixture of climatic drivers, with precipitation being particularly significant. Extreme rainfall has been linked to large Campylobacter outbreaks. Although campylobacteriosis is rarely fatal, its global disease burden is high and is predicted to increase due to changing populations, exposure patterns, and antimicrobial resistance.\\n\\nThis study analyzes the temporal and spatial relationship between climatic factors and the incidence of Campylobacter in the Nordic countries using a Poisson regression model.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Campylobacter and Climate at Baseline (2000–2015)\\n\\nA total of 64,034 reported cases of Campylobacter were included in the final database. The average number of cases per municipality was 154, with a range from 0 to 274. The average annual number of cases per 100,000 persons was 42, varying from 25 in Norway to 60 in Denmark.\\n\\nThe average weekly temperature was 4.4 °C, and the average daily precipitation was 2.2 mm. Each municipality experienced an average of 2.4 heat waves and 3.3 heavy precipitation events during the study period.\\n\\nThe Poisson regression models predicted 79.7% and 84.5% of data records correctly for winter and summer months, respectively.

Specifically, increases in temperature and heavy rainfall may increase the number of Campylobacter cases reported the following week. On the other hand, according to our models, heat waves and winter precipitation (i.e., both rain and snowfall) may decrease the number of cases reported. Generally, these results support the theory that transmission via the environment could be important for cases which are not explained by consumption or handling of poultry.\\n\\nPeople in the Nordic countries are weather dependent and spend an increasing amount of time outdoors when weather conditions are suitable, resulting in a higher likelihood of contact with environmental infection sources. At the same time, heavy rainfall can mobilize and distribute bacteria, facilitating transmission from contact with water and mud rather than dry surfaces.\\n\\nOur predicted climate changes were based on projections from the EUR-11 HIRHAM-5 RCM for the RCP8.5 scenario. According to these, by the year 2100, average annual temperatures in the Nordic countries may increase by an average of 4.2 °C, ranging from 3.5 °C in the southernmost parts to 5 °C in northern and central areas. Precipitation is predicted to increase by 25% with only small variations between the countries, and heavy precipitation events can increase by up to 45% across the region. The frequency of heat waves in this region is also affected by climate changes, with an overall 20% increase predicted for most areas (but up to 45% in some parts of Norway).\\n\\nBy incorporating these climate changes into our models, we estimate an overall increase in campylobacteriosis of almost 200% by the end of this century. This translates to nearly 6,000 excess Campylobacter cases per year in these four countries which could potentially be linked only to climate changes. Campylobacteriosis is a highly seasonal disease in the Nordic countries, and our models also indicate a future change in the seasonality of the disease.\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:13874 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70593-y\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Incidences\\n\\n#\\n# Predicted Campylobacter Incidences in Scandinavia (2000–2090)\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study analyzes the predicted incidences of Campylobacter in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden from 2000 to 2090, highlighting the impact of climate change on disease patterns.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter is a significant cause of foodborne illness worldwide.

Weekly averages for temperature, precipitation, heat waves, and heavy precipitation events were computed and aggregated into ten-year averages.\\n\\nData exploration was conducted using descriptive statistics. The relationship between Campylobacter cases and climate was modeled using three approaches: standard Poisson regression, zero-inflated Poisson regression, and standard Poisson regression excluding zero cases. Time-lags were analyzed to determine the optimal interval between reported cases and climate measurements.\\n\\nThe final model was adjusted for week, year, municipality, and interactions between climate variables, with separate models for winter and summer periods. Model predictive fits were evaluated using a subset of data records omitted from the analysis.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe best fit models were applied to baseline climate data and EUR-11 climate change scenario data, estimating average cases per municipality per week for 2000–2015 and in ten-year intervals from 2040 to 2089. The predictive accuracy of the models was assessed by comparing predicted cases to observed cases.\\n\\nExcess Campylobacter cases attributed to climate change were calculated by estimating expected cases for 2040–2089 and subtracting these from the predicted cases based on climate change scenarios.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\nData were analyzed using STATA software 14.0 and GIS analyses were conducted using QGIS 2.14.11.\\n\\n# Ethical Considerations\\n\\nThis study was approved under the general agreement for non-interventional database studies between the Danish Data Protection Agency and Statens Serum Institut. Ethical committee approval was not required as the study did not involve biological material from human subjects.\\n\\n# Data Availability\\n\\nThe data generated and analyzed during this study are classified as sensitive surveillance data and are not publicly available.

Rotavirus infections have minimal to strong seasonality depending on geographical locations. In this study, a comprehensive retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the association between rotavirus admission and multiple key meteorological variables, including air temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation over a 15-year period from 1995 to 2009 in Hong Kong. Rotavirus infections were found to show a distinct cyclical pattern with an annual peak in cold season. The weekly number of cases showed the strongest correlation with average air temperature of the previous 7 days (rho = 0.69; P < 0.0001), followed by atmospheric pressure (rho = +0.67; P < 0.0001); whereas only weak correlation with relative humidity (rho = 0.252; P < 0.0001) and solar radiation (rho = 0.312; P < 0.0001) was observed. Curve fitting regression analysis suggested that the correlation was nonlinear in nature in which the effect was more profound towards lower air temperature and higher atmospheric pressure conditions. In binary logistic regression analysis, a final model that included air temperature (20˚C) and atmospheric pressure (1,013 hPa) predicted correctly 85.3% and 82.6% of weeks with rotavirus activity above and below the baseline level, respectively. In multivariate Poisson model, air temperature and solar radiation were independent factors associated with the weekly number of rotavirus cases, adjusted for seasonal variation. In summary, the current study provides evidence suggesting that local seasonal activity of rotavirus correlated strongly with air temperature, followed by atmospheric pressure but only minimally with relative humidity in pre-vaccine era.\\n\\nKEY WORDS:\\n\\nrotavirus; air temperature; atmospheric pressure; relative humidity; solar radiation; Hong Kong\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is a leading cause of severe infectious diarrhea in infants and young children aged <5 years [Parashar et al., 2006], accounting for 36% of hospitalizations for diarrhea and around 453,000 deaths every year globally [WHO, 2011; Tate et al., 2012]. Rotavirus infections have minimal to strong seasonality depending on geographical locations.

The number of pediatric cases aged <5 years admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection, as determined by a qualitative enzyme immunoassay for serotype group A, between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2009 were used as an indicator of local rotavirus activity.\\n\\n# Acquisition and Compilation of Meteorological Data\\n\\nDaily data on air temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure were recorded by the Hong Kong Observatory’s automatic weather station in the Shatin district where the hospital is located. Daily total solar radiation was recorded at the King’s Park Meteorological Station located at the Kowloon peninsula, which was about 8 km away from Shatin. To correlate meteorological data with rotavirus activity, it was assumed that there was a lead time between the causal effect of meteorological changes and the resultant hospital admission due to rotavirus infection. This lead time included an incubation period of 2 days for rotavirus [CDC, 2012] plus the delay in seeking medical care after symptom onset. In this regard, collected meteorological data were compiled first into “7-day average” format before further analysis as described previously in a similar study for influenza A and B viruses [Chan et al., 2009]. Specifically, to correlate the weekly total number of rotavirus cases in a particular week (Days 1–7) with air temperature, the 7-day average air temperature of the previous week (i.e., Days 6 to 0) were used for correlation analysis. Similar data compilation approach was used for other meteorological factors.\\n\\n# Geography and Climate of Hong Kong\\n\\nHong Kong lies between latitude 22˚08'N and 22˚, longitude 113˚49'E and 114˚31'E with a land area of 1,104 km2. It is a coastal city populated densely (7.1 million) and located in the southern part of China at the Pearl River Estuary, facing South China Sea. Hong Kong has a subtropical monsoonal climate, tending towards temperate for nearly half the year with cold and dry winters, and hot and humid summers [HKO, 2012]. From November to February next year, with occasional cold fronts followed by dry northerly winds, temperature fluctuates usually between 15 and 20˚C but may drop occasionally below 10˚C. May to early September are hot and humid. Afternoon temperatures often exceed 31˚C with relative humidity over 80% for most of the time. Thundery showers and heavy rain are also common in these months.\\n\\n# Data and Statistical Analysis\\n\\nCorrelation between two continuous variables was evaluated using non-parametric Spearman’s rank test. A final model for predicting rotavirus activity was built using binary logistic regression. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 20 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Effect of meteorological changes on rotavirus cases was analyzed using Poisson generalized additive model adjusted for seasonal variation with the function mgcv of R version 2.12.1. All P-values were two-tailed and a value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Charts and plots were generated using SPSS Statistics or Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA), where appropriate.\\n\\nJ. Med. Virol.

The median yearly number of cases was 375 (interquartile range [IQR] 294–403). In general, the activity of rotavirus remained low during June–October (defined as “baseline”) and rose above baseline level from October through April next year (defined as “season”) with peak activity occurring typically in December and January crossing calendar years (Fig. 1). At baseline, the weekly number of rotavirus cases ranged from 0 to 12 with a median of 2 (IQR 1–3). During rotavirus seasons, the median weekly number of cases was 10 (IQR 5–15), and exceeded 30 in 87% (13/15) of the peaks. The number of cases admitted during rotavirus season appeared on the rise across the study period but the long-term trend did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.112, Jonckheere–Terpstra trend test).\\n\\n# Association Between Rotavirus Cases and Meteorological Factors\\n\\nOver the 15-year study period, rotavirus infections showed a distinct cyclical pattern with an annual peak (Fig. 2). The only exceptions were in the 1997/1998 and 2007/2008 seasons during which 2–3 peaks of comparable magnitude separated 1- and 3-months apart were noted, respectively. Similar distinct cyclical patterns were also observed for 7-day average air temperature and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 2). In contrast, seasonal variation of 7-day average relative humidity and solar radiation were more variable and cyclical patterns were much less obvious (Fig. 2). Generally, peak rotavirus infections coincided with lowest 7-day average air temperature and relative humidity and highest atmospheric pressure. Quantitatively, weekly number of rotavirus infections showed the strongest correlation with 7-day average air temperature (rho = 0.69; P < 0.0001), followed by atmospheric pressure (rho = +0.67; P < 0.0001); whereas only a weak correlation with solar radiation (rho = 0.312; P < 0.0001) and relative humidity (rho = 0.252; P < 0.0001) was observed (Fig. 3). Curve fitting regression analysis further suggested that the correlation was nonlinear in nature. The effect on the weekly number of rotavirus infections was more profound towards lower air temperature and higher atmospheric pressure (Fig. 3).\\n\\n# Favorable Climate Zone for Rotavirus\\n\\nIn phase diagrams of different combinations of meteorological factors, weeks with rotavirus activity above baseline level (>12; Fig. 4, panel A) and at peak (three consecutive weeks comprising the first peak of each season; Fig. 4, panel B) clustered principally into elliptic zones. Using a holistic approach, a favorable climate zone for peak rotavirus activity was defined as having a 7-day average air temperature...\\n\\nFig. 1.

Temporal distribution of weekly number of rotavirus cases with four meteorological factors (7-day average air temperature, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, and relative humidity of the previous week) from 1995 to 2009 in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that peak rotavirus activity occurred under specific meteorological conditions: air temperature of 20˚C or below, atmospheric pressure of 1,013 hPa or above, and solar radiation of 16 MJ/m2 or below. Notably, peak rotavirus activity occurred over a wide range of relative humidity (40–90%), indicating that this factor is not a reliable predictor.\\n\\n# Modeling of Meteorological Changes on Rotavirus Cases\\n\\nThe effect of meteorological factors from the previous week on the weekly number of rotavirus cases was summarized in Table I. In the univariate Poisson additive model, all four meteorological factors were significantly associated with the weekly number of rotavirus admissions. A unit decrease in air temperature and relative humidity led to a rise of 3.3% and 1.2% in rotavirus cases, respectively. Conversely, a unit increase in atmospheric pressure and solar radiation led to a rise of 3.4% and 2.7% in rotavirus cases, respectively.\\n\\nIn the multivariate Poisson additive model with backward selection, only air temperature and solar radiation were independent factors associated with the weekly number of rotavirus cases. In both analyses, air temperature emerged as a leading factor influencing rotavirus seasonality.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThis study observed a cyclical pattern of rotavirus infections, with peak activity typically occurring during the cold months from December to January, a characteristic feature of many cities with temperate climates. Lower average air temperature and higher atmospheric pressure from the previous week correlated with increased rotavirus activity. The involvement of atmospheric pressure is not surprising, as there is a causal relationship between low air temperature and high-pressure systems.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Activity and Meteorological Variations\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 10px;\\n}\\n.correlation {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Activity and Meteorological Variations\\n\\nSpearman's rho: 0.690 (p < 0.0001)\\n\\nSpearman's rho: 0.670 (p < 0.0001)\\n\\nFig. 3.

Favorable climate zones for rotavirus activity are shaded in pink.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nSuch discrepancy remains unexplained, but it is of note that in the latter study the effect of air temperature on rotavirus activity, as in line with the findings reported in the current study, was more pronounced than that of relative humidity. One of the meteorological factors that remain poorly studied is solar radiation. In an attempt to establish any association of this factor with rotavirus seasonality, discordant results were obtained between univariate and multivariate analyses. It is likely that noisy intra- and inter-annual fluctuation of solar radiation complicates data analysis.\\n\\nTransmission and seasonal prevalence of viral infections are complex events. Contributing factors include virus tropism and virulence, host genetics, immunity and social behavior, and environmental factors that affect both virus and host.\\n\\n# Table of Meteorological Factors\\n\\n|Meteorological Factor|Incidence Rate Ratio|95% CI|P-value| |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Univariate|Air temperature (°C)|0.967|0.947–0.988|0.003|\\n| |Atmospheric pressure (hPa)|1.034|1.017–1.051|<0.0001|\\n| |Relative humidity (%)|0.988|0.983–0.993|<0.001|\\n|Multivariate|Air temperature (°C)|0.958|0.937–0.979|<0.001|\\n| |Solar radiation (MJ/m²)|1.032|1.017–1.048|<0.0001|\\n\\nCI, confidence interval.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Activity and Meteorological Variations\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-indent: 20px;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Activity and Meteorological Variations\\n\\nBehavior are believed to play a key role in shaping seasonality. In a previous study, rotavirus aerosolized experimentally in fecal suspension was found to maintain higher infectivity in vitro at lower temperatures [Ijaz et al., 1985]. Higher virus stability in cold weather allows rotavirus to persist longer in fecal matters and on contaminated environmental surfaces, increasing the chance of virus transmission via fecal–oral route. This may account for the characteristic winter seasonality of rotavirus. Similar influence of meteorological factors on virus seasonality has been noted in other viruses such as influenza [Lowen et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2009] and respiratory syncytial viruses [Chan et al., 1999; Noyola and Mandeville, 2008]. Alternatively, behavioral and lifestyle changes of the general public with season may drive rotavirus seasonality. In winter months, people tend to stay longer indoors to avoid adverse weather and to keep warm, providing ample time for person-to-person contacts in semi-closed environment. Recently, in a Belgian survey study, longer duration of social contact during weekends and holidays were shown to outweigh meteorological factors on influenza transmission [Willem et al., 2012]. It is therefore intriguing to speculate whether clustering of long holidays and gathering of people near New Year for celebration in winter months catalyze rotavirus transmission. Finally, overall reduced immunity during winter may render the target population more susceptible to infection [Nelson and Demas, 1996].\\n\\nRecent epidemiological studies in the US and other countries have shown a rapid decline (>40%) in the weekly number of rotavirus admissions after implementation of national rotavirus vaccination [Cortes et al., 2011; do Carmo et al., 2011; Yen et al., 2011]. Of note, emerging evidence hints that the introduction of vaccination may interfere with the traditional spatiotemporal pattern of rotavirus activity [Curns et al., 2011]. Considering that World Health Organization recommended in mid-2009 that rotavirus vaccination be included in all national immunization programs [WHO, 2009], the current study thus provides important baseline data on the association between the seasonal incidence of rotavirus and meteorological factors before the widespread use of rotavirus vaccines. Further investigation on the association in the post-vaccine era is warranted.\\n\\nThis study has limitations. First, rotavirus admission volume and meteorological data were retrieved from a single center and geographic location, respectively. Whether findings could be extrapolated to other cities remain to be determined. Nevertheless, data derived from a single center have a better quality in terms of consistency in the threshold of admission and laboratory testing. It is also worth noting that meteorological criteria (7-day average air temperature 20˚C and atmospheric pressure 1,013 hPa) formulated here to forecast rotavirus season have a good predictive value of >85% over the 15-year study period and would be applicable to neighboring cities with comparable climate. Second, other environmental factors associated with air quality, particularly the concentration of ozone, a chemical shown previously to inactivate rotavirus [Vaughn et al., 1987] was not evaluated. Recently, norovirus, another common cause of acute gastroenteritis second to rotavirus in infants and young children, has been implicated in airborne route of transmission from aerosolization of contaminated fomites [Repp and Keene, 2012]. The influence of air pollutants such as suspended particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) on the environmental survival and transmissibility of rotavirus deserves further investigation.\\n\\nIn summary, this study provides evidence suggesting that local seasonal activity of rotavirus correlated strongly with air temperature, followed by atmospheric pressure but only minimally with relative humidity of the previous week over a 15-year study period. A set of meteorological conditions favorable for rotavirus activity was also proposed. Further studies on the roles of social and environmental factors and vaccination on rotavirus seasonality are needed.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAnderson EJ, Weber SG. 2004.

Contact with and ingestion of raw or undercooked broilers are considered the dominant risk factors for infection. In this study, we investigated the temporal relationship between the disease incidence in humans and the prevalence of Campylobacter in broilers in Switzerland from 2008 to 2012. We use a time-series approach to describe the pattern of the disease by incorporating seasonal effects and autocorrelation. The analysis shows that prevalence of Campylobacter in broilers, with a 2-week lag, has a significant impact on disease incidence in humans. Therefore Campylobacter cases in humans can be partly explained by contagion through broiler meat. We also found a strong autoregressive effect in human illness, and a significant increase of illness during Christmas and New Year’s holidays. In a final analysis, we corrected for the sampling error of prevalence in broilers and the results gave similar conclusions.\\n\\nKey words: Incidence of Campylobacter in humans, prevalence of Campylobacter in broilers, time-series analysis.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter species are present in most warm-blooded animals and campylobacteriosis is transmitted to humans from animals or animal products. In animals, Campylobacter seldom causes disease. For humans, transmission occurs through consumption of contaminated food, water and milk products, as well as directly from animals and the environment. Contact with and the ingestion of raw or undercooked broiler meat are considered the dominant risk factors for infection. The consumption of chicken is estimated to account for between 40% and 70% of human infections. Several studies show that the incidence of Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and the incidence of campylobacteriosis in humans show a concordant seasonality in Europe. Campylobacter illness in humans has a clear seasonal pattern with an annual peak during the summer.\\n\\nThis is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\\n\\n© Cambridge University Press 2014 | doi:10.1017/S0950268814002738\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis in Switzerland\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis in Switzerland\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis is a significant public health concern, particularly in Switzerland, where the incidence of reported cases has shown a seasonal pattern. This study investigates the relationship between the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks and the incidence of Campylobacter illness in humans.\\n\\n# Data\\n\\n# Incidence in Humans\\n\\nSince a mandatory notification was introduced in 1988, all laboratory confirmations of Campylobacter samples of patients must be notified to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) in Switzerland. Human samples were cultured for Campylobacter spp. in several different laboratories. The number of cases reported to FOPH as well as the notification rate are published weekly in the FOPH Bulletin.\\n\\nTo explore the disease dynamics, we aggregated the data to weekly counts of Campylobacter cases in 2008-2012, shown in Figure 1. The disease follows a seasonal pattern, with a peak every summer, and a second distinct peak of around 2–3 weeks during the Christmas holiday season, possibly related to the increased consumption of fondue Chinoise. When eating fondue, the risk of contamination increases when raw meat is placed on the same plate as the cooked food. This seasonal pattern is visible in all five years considered.\\n\\nFig. 1. Weekly number of reported human campylobacteriosis cases in Switzerland, 2008–2012\\n\\n# Prevalence in Broiler Flocks\\n\\nThe prevalence in broilers is monitored by testing broiler samples, which are collected by private companies or the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office (SFVO) in Switzerland. In 2008–2009, the data were from the pre-delivery control system in a large slaughterhouse. A total of 1959 flocks were tested in 2008 and 1983 flocks in 2009. Calculation of prevalence was based on the date of slaughter, where a slaughter group was regarded as positive if at least one of the samples tested positive for Campylobacter.\\n\\nFrom 2010 to 2012, we calculated the prevalence based on the sample results from SFVO. In the surveillance system, a random sample of broiler flocks was investigated at slaughter every week. The broiler slaughter plants included in the surveillance programme account for over 90% of the total production of broilers in Switzerland. The number of samples for each plant was determined in proportion to the number of animals slaughtered per year. Each sample represents one flock. The poultry samples were all analysed in the Swiss reference laboratory (Centre for Zoonotic Diseases, Bacterial Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance, University of Bern).\\n---\\n# Time-series Analysis of Campylobacter Incidence in Switzerland\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid black;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\n\\n# Time-series Analysis of Campylobacter Incidence in Switzerland\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nThe prevalence of Campylobacter in broilers has been a significant concern in public health due to its association with human infections. This study aims to analyze the time-series data of Campylobacter incidence in Switzerland, focusing on the prevalence in broilers over several years.\\n\\n# 2. Methods\\n\\n# Imputation of Prevalence in Broilers\\n\\nTo investigate the association between disease incidence in humans and prevalence in broilers, we sampled using five cloacal swabs per flock (each from five different broilers) in standard transportation medium (Transport swabs, Oxoid TS0001A, Amies W/O CH). At the laboratory, cloacal swabs were pooled, and direct culture was carried out on selective medium suitable for Campylobacter (mCCDA, Oxoid, Switzerland). Samples were further identified to the species level, with C. jejuni and C. coli being the main species identified.\\n\\nIn total, 489 samples were positive, 923 negative, and 129 results were unavailable. Between 1 and 37 samples were tested each week. The prevalence based on the samples in week t is calculated as:\\n\\npt = x / n, where xt denotes the number of positive sampled groups and nt the total number of samples.'),\n",

For example, this is often the case in weeks 1 and 52, which may be due to public holidays in Switzerland. We applied an algorithm to impute the missing prevalence values. We also used this approach to adjust for the sampling error in the prevalence estimates.\\n\\nThe prevalence of Campylobacter in broilers has a similar seasonal pattern as incidence in humans. The prevalence pattern shows a gradual rise from the beginning of the year, peaking in summer, and decreasing in autumn, until the prevalence reaches the lowest value towards the end of the year, as shown in Figure 2.\\n\\nFig. 2.

The imputation of missing data using sinusoidal regression models has proven effective in providing a more accurate representation of prevalence over time. This methodology not only addresses gaps in data collection but also enhances the reliability of prevalence estimates by correcting for sampling errors.\\n\\n# 5. Conclusion\\n\\nThis study highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of Campylobacter prevalence in broilers as a means to understand and mitigate risks associated with human infections. Future research should focus on integrating these findings with human health data to develop comprehensive public health strategies.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Analysis of Imputation Models on Prevalence in Broilers\\n\\n|S|p|Log L|AIC|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|1|3|50.91|-93.83|\\n|2|5|54.69|-97.37|\\n|3|7|64.6|-113.19|\\n|4|9|66.78|-113.56|\\n|5|11|66.79|-109.59|\\n\\nAIC, Akaike’s Information Criterion. The log-likelihood is denoted as log L, p is the number of parameters in the model, S is the number of sinusoidal waves, AIC = −2 log L + 2p.\\n\\n# Time-Series Model\\n\\nWe applied the time-series model for count data as described in [14] on the number of campylobacteriosis cases in humans. The formulation is based on an additive decomposition of disease incidence into an endemic component Xt and an autoregressive epidemic component Y. Let Zt denote the number of reported cases in week t, where t ∈ 1,2, . . . , n. The basic model assumes that Xt ∼ Po(ν) and Yt ∼ Po(λ Zt−1) are independent, so:\\n\\nZt = Xt + Yt ∼ Po(νt + λZt−1).\\n\\nHere Xt represents the endemic component with Poisson rate νt where:\\n\\nlog(ν) = αν + ∑[γν,ssin(ωt) + δν,scos(ωt)], where s=1 to S.\\n\\nAs in the previous section, the frequencies ωs = 2πs/52 are used but the number S of sinusoidal waves may be chosen differently. The epidemic component Yt forms an autoregression on the total number of cases Zt−1 in the previous week with unknown parameter λ. The Poisson assumption for Zt ∼ Po(μ) can be relaxed using a negative binomial distribution NBin(μ, tψ) to correct for possible overdispersion.\\n\\nBy using the approach described by [15], additional (time-changing) explanatory variables can be included in the endemic or epidemic component. The epidemic component is then time-dependent, i.e. λt replaces λ in equation (1). In our analysis, an indicator variable WeekNumber = {1 if calendar week is 1, 2 or 52; 0 otherwise} for the fondue season is included in the endemic component to adjust for the sharp incidence peak around the New Year period. In addition, the prevalence in broilers can be used as an explanatory variable either as the endemic (model A) or as the epidemic (model B) component:\\n\\n# Model A:\\n\\nlog(νt) = αν + θ · WeekNumber + φν · vt−l + ∑[γssin(ωt) + δscos(ωt)], where s=1 to S.\\n\\nlog(λ) = αλ · t\\n\\n# Model B:\\n\\nlog(νt) = αν + θ · WeekNumber + ∑[γssin(ωt) + δscos(ωt)], where s=1 to S.\\n\\nlog(λ) = αλ + φλ · vt−l,t, where vt−l is the prevalence with l ∈ {−3,. . .,3} weeks of lag. All calculations were carried out in the statistical software environment R 3.1.1 [16] using the package surveillance 1.8.0 [14].\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Temporal Analysis Excluding Prevalence in Broilers\\n\\nWe conducted a univariate analysis of incidence in humans, adjusting for seasonality and the effect of the New Year. The model without an autoregressive epidemic component is a generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Poisson or negative binomial observation model. When including a seasonality adjustment, the negative binomial model fits much better in terms of AIC than the corresponding Poisson model. This indicates that the number of campylobacteriosis cases in humans is overdispersed. The inclusion of the epidemic component with estimated autoregressive parameter ^λ = 0.52 leads to a further improvement of the maximized log-likelihood and AIC. Consequently, the use of a GLM seems inappropriate for these data. Increasing the number of sinusoidal waves to S = 2 leads to a slight improvement of the maximum log-likelihood; therefore, the best model in terms of AIC is the negative binomial model with two sinusoidal waves as well as an autoregression component.\\n\\nFigure 3 compares the observed and fitted number of cases for the two final negative binomial models with and without an autoregression component.\\n---\\n# Time-series Analysis of Campylobacter Incidence in Switzerland'),\n",

Deviance residuals and the autocorrelation functions (ACF) of the residuals in the corresponding models are also shown in Figure 3. The residuals of the autoregressive model are approximately uncorrelated, while in the GLM the residual autocorrelation is substantial for small time lags, e.g., ACF = 0.6 for lag l = 1. This gives further evidence for the need to include the autoregressive component.\\n\\n# Temporal Analysis Including Prevalence in Broilers\\n\\nWe further investigated the impact of the inclusion of prevalence in broilers as an explanatory variable in the model. A delayed effect of prevalence in broilers on human illness should be taken into consideration, due to varying consumption periods of broiler meat (e.g., time for meat in transport, retail, and consumption) and the incubation period of the illness. Therefore, we investigated the impact of prevalence in broilers by varying lags up to 3 weeks. Forward lags l ∈ {−3,−2,−1} in models A and B were also included in the analysis to assess the direction of the association between prevalence in broilers and incidence in humans.\\n\\nFigure 4 gives the estimated coefficient φˆ with its 95% confidence interval for each model. For comparison, results from a negative binomial GLM are also included. The estimated effect is largest for lag l = 2 with ˆν = φ0.36 (P = 0.018), φˆλ = 0.32 (P = 0.02) and φˆ = 0.23.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.highlight {\\nfont-weight: bold;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nFigure 4 illustrates the estimated coefficient of the lagged prevalence in broilers (with 95% confidence intervals) in the endemic (model A), epidemic (model B) component, or generalized linear model (GLM) with seasonality (S = 2).\\n\\n(P = 0.008), with 95% confidence intervals covering only positive values indicating a significant impact on incidence in humans. The evidence for a positive lag l = 1 association is weaker, since the lower limits of the 95% confidence interval are now negative. There is no evidence for an association for negative lags (| ˆ| φ, 0.1 for all three models). This indicates that a change in the prevalence in broilers might be associated with a change in incidence rate in humans after a 2-week delay. The comparison of each model in terms of AIC values is shown in Table 2. In terms of AIC, including the prevalence in the previous 2 weeks in the endemic component gives the best fit (highlighted in Table 2).\\n\\nThe model with the smallest AIC value is given in bold face. Model A is a model with the prevalence in broilers as endemic component, model B with the prevalence as epidemic component. GLM represents a generalized linear model including prevalence without an autoregressive component.\\n\\nAdditional analyses were performed to study the impact of sampling error in the estimates of prevalence in broilers. To do this, the fitted prevalence from the ‘Imputation of prevalence in broilers’ section has been used instead of the original values. The estimated coefficient φˆ ν = 1.58 (S.E. = 0.59) of the prevalence in broilers 2 weeks earlier is now larger than it is in Figure 4 (ˆν φ = 0.36), as expected after correction for sampling error. The corresponding AIC value from the best model with S = 2 and lag 2 is 2400.56, which is slightly better than the best model A with original values. Figure 5 compares the number of disease cases from the original and estimated prevalence in broilers, respectively, which are quite similar. This analysis shows that after correction for sampling error in the prevalence estimates of broilers, a stronger effect of prevalence in broilers can be observed.\\n\\n# Table 2: AIC Values in Models Including the Prevalence in Broilers with Different Weeks of Lag and Seasonality S = 2\\n\\n|Lag|Model A|Model B|GLM|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|-3|2407.32|2407.54|2482.39|\\n|-2|2407.63|2407.42|2481.94|\\n|-1|2407.42|2407.50|2481.80|\\n|0|2407.27|2407.23|2482.38|\\n|1|2404.52|2405.30|2479.60|\\n|2|2401.97|2402.40|2475.48|\\n|3|2407.68|2407.53|2480.17|\\n\\nAIC, Akaike’s Information Criterion.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nIn the present paper, we applied a time-series model for incidence of Campylobacter in humans in order to investigate a possible association between campylobacteriosis in humans and prevalence of...\\n---\\n# Time-series Analysis of Campylobacter Incidence in Switzerland\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n.chart {\\ndisplay: flex;\\njustify-content: space-around;\\n}\\n.chart div {\\nwidth: 45%;\\n}\\n\\n# Time-series Analysis of Campylobacter Incidence in Switzerland\\n\\n# (a)\\n\\nObserved and Epidemic Endemic Number of Cases\\n\\n# (b)\\n\\nFitted Number of Disease Cases in Humans\\n\\nWe found a positive direct association with a delay of 2 weeks.

Only cases with laboratory confirmation were included, and we are well aware of the problem of possible underreporting in the time series of campylobacteriosis cases. On the other hand, our formulation can be considered as useful as long as the underreporting rate does not change with time. The human data comprise cases of all ages. Thus, differences in broiler consumption patterns in different age groups may lead to a shift in the evaluation of the impact of broilers, but it is impossible to discern such shifts from age-aggregated surveillance data.'),\n",

On the other hand, our formulation can be considered as useful as long as the underreporting rate does not change with time. The human data comprise cases of all ages. Thus, differences in broiler consumption patterns in different age groups may lead to a shift in the evaluation of the impact of broilers, but it is impossible to discern such shifts from age-aggregated surveillance data.\\n\\nHuman incidence may not only be related to the presence of Campylobacter spp. on poultry carcasses, but also on the number of bacteria present on each contaminated carcass. However, because the laboratory method for enumeration of Campylobacter is quite time-consuming, few data are available on seasonal variation of Campylobacter counts on poultry. A study in Belgium found no seasonal variation in Campylobacter counts.\\n\\nThere are many samples (68.4%) of broiler meat without information about the specific Campylobacter species, which restricts us to derive prevalence from either C. jejuni or C. coli, the two species associated with most of the disease cases. We are well aware that the data of prevalence in broilers originate from different sources for the years 2008–2009 and 2010–2012, respectively. But the seasonal pattern shows few differences between the two data sources.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.acknowledgements, .declaration, .references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder: 1px solid #ccc;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nIn the context of a slaughterhouse, the prevalence during winter time is slightly lower compared to the data representing the whole population. This might be due to the fact that this slaughterhouse has a comparably large percentage of flocks participating in label programmes for 'animal friendly' housing. These animals originate from stables with outdoor access or a 'winter garden'. Temperatures in these non-isolated poultry houses may be lower during winter than in traditional indoor housing. In addition, there is uncertainty about the true prevalence in broilers, when obtained from the collected sample results. To adjust for this, we conducted an analysis based on the fitted prevalence values from the imputation models. After adjusting for the sampling error in the whole prevalence series, the prevalence imputed shows a quite similar pattern to the prevalence in 2008–2009, which indicates that the sample bias from one slaughterhouse is not a distinct problem. The fitting results are slightly better in terms of AIC and the estimated impact of prevalence in broilers is much larger, which gives further evidence that the prevalence in broilers plays an important role for human infections.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank the two referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

In this study, multivariate regression models adapted for time-series data were used to investigate effects of temperature, humidity and rainfall on reported rotavirus infections and the infection-rate parameter, a derived measure of infection transmission that takes into account population immunity, in England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Delayed effects of weather were investigated by introducing lagged weather terms into the model. Meta-regression was used to pool together country-specific estimates. There was a 13 per cent (95% confidence interval (CI), 11–15%) decrease in reported infections per 1°C increase in temperature above a threshold of 5°C and a 4 per cent (95% CI, 3–5%) decrease in the infection-rate parameter per 1°C increase in temperature across the whole temperature range. The effect of temperature was immediate for the infection-rate parameter but delayed by up to four weeks for reported infections. There was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. There is a direct and simple relationship between cold weather and rotavirus transmission in Great Britain and The Netherlands. The more complex and delayed temperature effect on disease incidence is likely to be mediated through the effects of weather on transmission.\\n\\nKeywords: rotavirus; weather; temperature; relative humidity; rainfall; transmission\\n\\n# 1. INTRODUCTION\\n\\nEvery year, an estimated 610,000 children under 5 years of age die from rotavirus gastroenteritis globally, with the great majority occurring in developing countries (Parashar et al. 2006). In developed countries, rotavirus gastroenteritis remains a common cause of childhood hospitalization at great cost to health services (Giaquinto et al. 2007).\\n\\nIn temperate regions, rotavirus gastroenteritis is highly seasonal, and typically peaks during the winter or early spring (Cook et al. 1990). In the tropics, rotavirus gastroenteritis is more common during the dry season, but the seasonality is less marked (Cunliffe et al. 1998). The fading of the seasonal pattern with proximity to the equator and the difference of approximately six months between the peak incidence in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (Cook et al. 1990) suggests that climatic factors in part underlie the seasonality of rotavirus infections. Under laboratory conditions, rotavirus survival is optimal at low temperature (Moe & Shirley 1982; Moe & Harper 1983; Ijaz et al. 1985, 1994) but the relationship with relative humidity is less clear. Most survival studies of aerosolized rotavirus (Ijaz et al. 1985; Ansari et al. 1991) show that medium relative humidity is optimal for rotavirus survival, while survival tests of rotavirus on various surfaces have found optimal survival at low- and high-relative humidity (Moe & Shirley 1982) or best survival at low-relative humidity alone (Sattar et al. 1986).\\n\\nObservational studies of human rotavirus disease have suggested that lower temperature, lower relative humidity and lower levels of rainfall are associated with increased risk of rotavirus infections (Brandt et al. 1982; Paul & Erinle 1982; Ram et al. 1990; Gomwalk et al. 1993; Armah et al. 1994; Hashizume et al. 2007; D’Souza et al. 2008). A recent meta-analysis of the seasonality of rotavirus disease in the tropics concluded that higher numbers of rotavirus infections were found at colder and drier times of the year (Levy et al. 2008). However, only two of these studies (Hashizume et al. 2007; D’Souza et al. 2008) have used statistical methods that control for underlying trends and seasonal confounders. With crude methods, coincidental occurrences (e.g. in winter, low-temperature and high-rotavirus case counts) may be incorrectly posited as causal.\\n\\nRotavirus is transmitted by the faeco-oral route, from person to person directly or via contaminated fomites, food or water (Ansari et al. 1991). Some evidence also exists for airborne droplet spread (Zhaori et al. 1991).\\n\\nReceived 29 September 2009\\n\\nAccepted 3 November 2009\\n\\nThis journal is © 2009 The Royal Society\\n---\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nWe hypothesize that weather factors influence the incidence of rotavirus disease by affecting transmission of the virus and its survival in the environment. Rotavirus infection confers partial immunity (Velazquez et al. 1996), and thus the level of population immunity will also affect patterns of disease. As a result, climatic effects on the epidemiology of rotavirus disease are likely to be complex. Observed patterns of disease result from the dynamic interaction of seasonal patterns of viral transmissibility with levels of population immunity. Indeed, the delay and reduction in intensity of the rotavirus season in the USA following the introduction of vaccination (Tate et al. 2009) points to the role of population immunity in mediating seasonal patterns. A corollary of our hypothesis is that there is a simpler relationship (a more parsimonious model) between weather factors and transmissibility than between weather and disease patterns. The infection-rate parameter, which we estimate from a time series of laboratory-based surveillance data, is a measure of rotavirus transmissibility that accounts for changing levels of population immunity.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\n# (a) Rotavirus Surveillance Data\\n\\nThe Health Protection Agency collects reports of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections from medical microbiology laboratories across England and Wales. Health Protection Scotland and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) collect such reports in Scotland and The Netherlands, respectively. In all four countries, reporting by diagnostic laboratories is voluntary, but a recent survey in England and Wales indicated that in these two countries, laboratory testing practices are generally consistent year round (Atchison et al. 2009a). Weekly counts of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections between 1993 and 2007, based on illness onset date of the individual from whom the specimen was collected, were extracted from the national surveillance databases. Cases in older age groups are less frequent and are mainly restricted to overseas travellers, the immunocompromised and elderly individuals involved in institutional outbreaks (Bernstein 2009). Therefore, cases aged older than 5 years were excluded from the study, as infections in these groups are less likely to be associated with local weather factors.\\n\\n# (b) Quantifying the Transmission of Rotavirus Infections in the Population\\n\\nThe rotavirus surveillance data were used to quantify the transmission of rotavirus infections in the population, on the simplifying assumption that they reflect a ‘mass-action’ process. We estimated the transmission of rotavirus in the population from the relationship between the number of newly infected individuals in a given time period and the number of infectious and susceptible individuals in the same time period. We assumed that cases mix randomly with susceptibles in the population, that successive cases appear as chains of transmission, that susceptible individuals become cases after one serial interval of the infection (i.e. interval between identical stages of an infection in two successive cases) and that cases in one-time period become immune by the next time period.\\n\\nThe rate at which susceptibles become infected is described as follows (Stegeman et al. 1999):\\n\\nCt = bt St It / Nt'),\n",

When the infection-rate parameter is above one, the number of new cases will tend to rise, and cases fall when it drops below one. By definition, the population Nt = Ct + St + It. The infection-rate parameter bt is calculated by simple rearrangement of equation (2.1).\\n\\nFor calculating the infection-rate parameter, we assumed that rotavirus follows a simple susceptible–infectious–recovered/immune (S–I–R) pattern of infection. This is a simplification of the natural history of rotavirus, as children often experience multiple infections (Velazquez et al. 1996). However, moderate-to-severe diarrhoea predominantly occurs in primary infections (28% of primary infections), and disease severity is the primary determinant of laboratory confirmation of childhood diarrhoea in England (Tam et al. 2003). Primary infections are responsible for 86 percent of cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea with second and subsequent infections responsible for 14 percent and 0 percent, respectively (Velazquez et al. 1996). For these reasons, we assumed that children are only susceptible to one moderate-to-severe disease episode and that only these disease episodes are captured in the laboratory reports, thus reflecting the pattern of an S–I–R disease.\\n\\nBased on these characteristics and assumptions, we estimated the initial number of susceptibles at the start of the study period (S0) and the degree of under-ascertainment in the surveillance data for all rotavirus infections as well as for moderate-to-severe infections only. We used methods similar to those used by Fine & Clarkson (1982, 1984) to study the distribution of immunity in the population to pertussis and measles. These methods are described in detail in the electronic supplementary material, S1. The initial number of susceptibles estimated was 601,209, 33,757, 62,334 and 215,032 for England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands, respectively. Susceptibles made up approximately 20–22% of the under 5-year-old population in each study setting. The estimated overall under-ascertainment ratio for England of one reported case for every 44 community cases was broadly similar to that obtained in a population-based cohort study in England which estimated a ratio of 1 in 35 (Wheeler et al. 1999).\\n---\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\n# C. J. Atchison et al.\\n\\nDownloaded from http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org on March 29, 2015\\n\\n# Infectious Individuals and Under-Ascertainment\\n\\nThe number of infectious individuals in a given time period (I) was assumed to be the number of moderate-to-severe cases of rotavirus disease in the population in time period t. This estimate was obtained by multiplying the number of reported laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections in time period t by an under-ascertainment factor for moderate-to-severe cases. The number of newly infected individuals during time t (C) was assumed to be It+1. Therefore, this estimate was obtained by multiplying the number of reported laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections in time period t+1 by an under-ascertainment factor for moderate-to-severe cases. Methods for estimating the under-ascertainment of moderate-to-severe rotavirus cases in the surveillance data are described in detail in the electronic supplementary material, S1.\\n\\nIn the initial analyses, we assumed that the serial interval (t) was one week. Infectiousness begins with the onset of symptoms 24–72 h after infection, and the period of transmission lasts as long as the duration of symptoms (normal range 4–6 days) (Heymann 2004). Therefore, the serial interval can be as short as 1 day and as long as 9 days. A one-week interval was used because daily surveillance data are likely to suffer from reporting bias for certain days of the week. The infection-rate parameter calculated using a 4-day interval between successive cases closely resembled the pattern seen using a one-week interval.\\n\\nWe constructed a series of time periods by re-iterating equation (2.1), calculating the number susceptible at each time point as follows:\\n\\nSt+1 = St - Kt + Bt\\n\\nwhere the number of susceptibles remaining in the next time period (St+1) is a function of the number of susceptibles in the current time period (St), minus the number of these that become immune (Kt), plus the number of susceptibles introduced or born into the population (Bt). Assuming an S–I–R pattern of disease, the number immune (Kt) is equivalent to the number of individuals with a history of infection. Moderate-to-severe disease (It) represents only 28 percent of these infections. Therefore, It is adjusted accordingly to represent 100 percent infections to obtain an estimate of the number immune (Kt). Bt is the number of births per time period. We took into account annual and seasonal variation in birth rates over the surveillance period because birth rates (Pitzer et al. 2009) and season of birth (Atchison et al. 2009b) have been shown to affect timing and risk of rotavirus infections, and could in part explain the seasonal pattern of rotavirus disease. We assume deaths from rotavirus infections to be negligible as they are rare in developed countries (Jit et al. 2007) relative to the frequency of births or incidence of rotavirus infections.\\n\\n# Meteorological Data\\n\\nData on weather variables were obtained from the MIDAS Land Surface Observation database available from http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-midas. For each region of England and Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands, and for each weather variable, weather stations were selected if they provided data for at least 75 percent of the days from 1993 to 2007. At least 10 weather stations were used for each weather series. These stations were scattered throughout the geographical area that they represented.\\n\\nDaily mean values for ambient temperature, relative humidity and total rainfall across the weather stations were calculated and these measurements were used to construct population-weighted mean weekly series for the regions of England (the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, the Southeast and Southwest) and Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Weighting of weather measurements from each station contributing to the weather series was relative to the population density in immediate vicinity of the station. We used population-weighted weather series to better represent weather conditions in populated areas and improve our ability to detect the influence of weather factors on rotavirus infections. For temperature and relative humidity, the average daily measurement for the week was used. Total rainfall for the week was used to reflect the amount of excess water present in the environment and hence give a measure of exposure to water sources.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nRegression techniques adapted for analysis of time-series data (by incorporating lag effects, accounting for background seasonality, auto-correlation, over-dispersion) were used to model the relationship between temperature, relative humidity and total rainfall on rotavirus reports and the infection-rate parameter. We used an analogous approach for building up Poisson and simple linear multivariate regression models for weekly laboratory reports and the infection-rate parameter, respectively. In the final multivariate models, we controlled for confounding between weather factors and adjusted for long-term trends and background seasonality. This allowed us to estimate short-term effects of variables of interest (weather). The equations for the final models are described in detail in the electronic supplementary material, S2.'),\n",

This allowed us to estimate short-term effects of variables of interest (weather). The equations for the final models are described in detail in the electronic supplementary material, S2.\\n\\nLong-term trends and background seasonal patterns were accounted for as part of the confounder model so that regular patterns (i.e. both cold weather and high-rotavirus incidence occur in winter) were not inferred to be causal. To control for long-term trends, an indicator variable for a year was included in the model. Seasonal patterns not directly due to weather factors were accounted for by using an indicator variable for a month. Artificial drops in reporting during weeks that included public holidays were also accounted for by including an indicator variable for these weeks. To account for over-dispersion in the data, standard errors were scaled using the square root of Pearson-x2-goodness-of-fit statistic (Schwartz et al. 1996).\\n\\nTo investigate the delayed effects of weather on the outcome variables, lagged weather factors were introduced in the models (Armstrong 2006), e.g. the effect of lag one would be the effect of a weather variable measured in the week before, on the current week’s number of reported cases or infection-rate parameter. Detailed analyses demonstrated no delay in the effect of weather factors on the infection-rate parameter. A delay in weather effect of up to four weeks was observed for reported cases; therefore the mean of each weather.\\n---\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.table th, .table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\n}\\n.table th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nDownloaded from http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/ on March 29, 2015\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nThis research investigates the relationship between temperature and rotavirus transmission, utilizing statistical models to analyze the effects of weather variables on reported rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# 2. Methods\\n\\nTo determine the shape of the relationship between exposures and outcomes, natural cubic splines were fitted to the data, allowing the exposure–outcome relationship to be modeled by a smooth, nonlinear function (Durrleman & Simon 1989). All three sets of splines, one set for each weather variable, were included in the final model to control for confounding between weather factors.\\n\\nWhere there was evidence of a linear association between a weather variable and the outcome (likelihood-ratio test p-value < 0.05), a simple linear term for the weather variable was included in the multivariate model to estimate the effect of the weather variable on the outcome. The identification of the optimum threshold value was based on repeated regressions, varying the threshold by one exposure unit (e.g., 18°C) to find the best-fitting model as determined by Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) (Armstrong 2006).\\n\\nThe type of regression model selected for the two different outcome variables was based on the distribution of the outcome data and on respecting model assumptions. Counts of reported rotavirus cases were Poisson-distributed and therefore Poisson regression models were used. The effect measure was the risk ratio (RR), representing the relative increase (or decrease) in the number of rotavirus reports per unit change in temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), or total rainfall (mm).\\n\\n# 3. Results\\n\\nThere was a distinct and highly consistent late winter or early spring peak in laboratory reports in all populations studied. The infection-rate parameter showed a different pattern: it began to rise in weeks 28–32 and peaked at the beginning of each year in all settings, thus preceding the increase and peak in case reports by 10–12 weeks.\\n\\nFigure 1: Laboratory reports of rotavirus infections.\\n\\n# (a) Ambient temperature and reported rotavirus infections\\n\\nIn all nine regions of England, and in Wales, Scotland, and The Netherlands, there was an inverse relationship between mean temperature in the previous four weeks and rotavirus reports after controlling for trend, seasonality, public holidays, relative humidity, and rainfall.\\n\\nRegion\\nDecrease in Cases per 1°C Rise\\n\\nLondon, England\\n7%\\n\\nNortheast, West Midlands, Southeast, England\\n16%\\n\\nThe Netherlands\\nSimilar effect\\n\\nDistributed lag models estimating individual lag effects demonstrated that temperature had the greatest effect two to three weeks preceding an increase in cases with diminishing but positive effects up to four weeks.\\n\\nFigure 3: Lag effects of temperature on rotavirus cases.\\n\\n# 4.

Our findings support this hypothesis. Firstly, we demonstrated that the number of reported rotavirus infections was affected by temperatures in the preceding weeks, while the infection-rate parameter was affected only by temperatures in the same week. Secondly, the linear association between temperature and rotavirus reports was only apparent above a certain temperature threshold, while there was evidence of a linear relationship between temperature and the infection-rate parameter over the whole temperature range. The lagged association between temperature and rotavirus reports may reflect the fact that temperature affects case counts primarily through its influence on transmission. The relationship between transmission and the resulting number of clinical cases is a complex, nonlinear process that depends additionally on contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals, virus transmissibility, and host immunity. The final models for the infection-rate parameter fitted the data better and were more parsimonious than the models for case counts, as evidenced by plots of the fitted splines against the observed data, plots of the model residuals, and the much lower values of AIC. This also supports our hypothesis that temperature has a more direct effect on transmission than on rotavirus incidence per se.\\n\\nWe are aware of no other studies that have examined the relationship between a measure of rotavirus transmission and weather factors. Some studies have attempted to identify an association between the incidence of rotavirus cases and weather factors. However, only two studies, one set in Australia (D’Souza et al. 2008) and the other in Bangladesh (Hashizume et al. 2007), have used statistical methods to adjust for the potential confounding owing to other seasonal factors. In Australia (D’Souza et al. 2008), they found an increase in rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions in Brisbane.\\n---\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nDownloaded from http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/ on March 29, 2015\\n\\n# Table of Relative Risk and Regression Coefficient\\n\\n|Country|Relative Risk (95% CI)|Country|Regression Coefficient (×10–2) (95% CI)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|The Northeast|Overall: 0.87 (0.85–0.89)|The Northeast|Overall: –1.71 (–2.14 to –1.27)|\\n|The Northwest| | | |\\n|Yorkshire & Humberside| | | |\\n|East Midlands| | | |\\n|West Midlands| | | |\\n|East of England| | | |\\n|London| | | |\\n|The Southeast| | | |\\n|The Southwest| | | |\\n|Wales| | | |\\n|Scotland| | | |\\n|The Netherlands| | | |'),\n",

In Bangladesh (Hashizume et al. 2007), they found that high temperatures, low-relative humidity and high-river level in the previous four weeks were associated with an increase in hospital visits for rotavirus diarrhoea. Our finding of a strong negative association between reported rotavirus cases and temperature is consistent with the results from Australia and with laboratory evidence (Moe & Shirley 1982; Moe & Harper 1983). Our findings do not agree with the temperature results from the Bangladesh study, which also contrast with findings from the majority of laboratory and observational studies. As most of the high-temperature weeks in Bangladesh occurred during the monsoon season and there was evidence for temperature-effect modification across seasons in this study, the temperature effect may be exerted through complex temperature-dependent pathways in the monsoon season.\\n\\nOur findings for relative humidity are in contrast with those from Australia and Bangladesh. This could be explained by the fact that the range of relative humidity was greater in Australia and Bangladesh. Weather factors are likely to interact in complex ways specific to the setting and may be influenced by other unmeasured factors, including the degree of hygiene and sanitation in an area and specific human behaviours. These setting-specific factors may determine the extent to which weather factors influence the incidence of rotavirus cases and could account for the discrepancies in results seen in different study settings. In addition, laboratory studies that have looked at rotavirus survival at different relative humidity levels have produced contradictory findings which suggest that the association may be complex.\\n\\nWe found no evidence of an association between the number of rotavirus reports and rainfall. Studies that have looked at the relationship between rainfall and rotavirus have produced conflicting results (Brandt et al. 1982; Paul & Erinle 1982; Armah et al. 1994; Hashizume et al. 2007), and it may be that the effects of rainfall are complex, indirect and/or setting-specific.\\n\\nPitzer et al. (2009) recently investigated the relative contribution of climate factors and secular changes in birth rates on the timing of rotavirus epidemics in the US states. They found that environmental factors, including solar radiation, precipitation, vapour pressure and temperature, did not explain the observed variability in the peak week of rotavirus activity, either across states or over time. Our analysis differs from that of Pitzer et al. (2009), in that we focused on short-term effects of weather rather than on the time of year during which epidemics occur. Importantly, our analysis indicates that the effect of weather on rotavirus incidence is likely to be mediated through its effects on transmissibility. The difference between our results and those of Pitzer et al. (2009) is thus not so surprising; although weather influences rotavirus transmissibility, once a certain level of transmissibility is exceeded, population transmission dynamics are likely to determine the size and duration of the epidemic, and the influence of weather factors may be much less pronounced.\\n\\nTo estimate the infection-rate parameter, we had to make a number of simplifying assumptions. The assumption of a single homogeneous mixing population is not realistic for the populations included in this study, as social mixing patterns determine a limited and non-random contact set for each individual. Therefore, in our study, we have calculated an average infection-rate parameter for the entire population and it is likely that the actual transmission rate is underestimated. In addition, we did not include asymptomatic and mild cases in our calculation of the infection-rate parameter. The majority of household transmission studies have suggested that symptomatic individuals are more infectious and important in transmission than incubating or asymptomatically infected individuals (Haug et al. 1978; Rodriguez et al. 1979; Grimwood et al. 1983; Banerjee et al. 2008). Therefore, we feel that not accounting for asymptomatic and mild cases in our calculation of the infection-rate parameter was justified. However, if asymptomatic and mild cases do contribute significantly to transmission, then it is likely that the actual transmission rate is underestimated, but the seasonal pattern of the infection-rate parameter will remain unchanged as asymptomatic and mild cases exhibit the same seasonal incidence as moderate-to-severe cases in our study settings (Walther et al. 1983; Iturriza-Gomara et al. 2009).\\n---\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-indent: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nmargin-left: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Temperature and Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nC. J. Atchison et al.\\n\\nThe quality of the rotavirus surveillance data may be a limitation of our study. Only a proportion of cases in the community are reported in national surveillance data, and those cases reported are not necessarily representative of all cases, as reported cases are likely to be more severe (Tam et al. 2003). This is unlikely to affect the validity of the comparisons made over time, provided that the nature and degree of under-ascertainment remained constant over the study period. A recent survey of clinical laboratory practices for rotavirus detection (Atchison et al. 2009a) found that most laboratories in England and Wales test for rotavirus all year round in all cases of gastroenteritis under 5 years of age and that the degree of under-ascertainment and the testing criteria for rotavirus did not vary significantly over time. The under-ascertainment estimates for England were internally consistent and similar to a previous empirical estimate (Wheeler et al. 1999).\\n\\nAnother potential limitation of our study is the high variability of the data, apparent from the considerable scatter of the data points above and below the fitted curve (figure 2). The reason for this is uncertain, but might depend on a number of factors. The use of regional and country weather series could have diluted the weather effects and resulted in the high variability. More detailed city-specific analysis might have addressed this problem albeit at the loss of statistical power. We used population-weighted weather series to better reflect weather conditions in more populated areas and to improve our ability to detect the influence of weather variables on rotavirus infections.\\n\\nIt is not known where (outdoors versus indoors) children are being infected with rotavirus, although it is known from transmission studies that infants and young children are commonly infected outside of the household (Koopman et al. 1989). In England and Wales, significant risk factors for rotavirus infection include contact with persons with rotavirus infection, living in rented public housing and accommodation with fewer rooms (Sethi et al. 2001). If infection is transmitted indoors by individuals living in close proximity to each other (i.e. households with fewer rooms and overcrowding), then one possible explanation for the cold-weather effect could be that low ambient temperatures encourage these individuals to stay indoors in tightly closed households, increasing their exposure to contaminated air, surfaces or individuals. If infection is transmitted outdoors, an important effect of low temperature might be to prolong survival of the virus in the environment (Moe & Shirley 1982; Ansari et al. 1991), increasing the likelihood of exposure to infectious virus.\\n\\nIn summary, our study shows that colder weather has a direct and immediate effect on the transmission of rotavirus infections, and a more complex and delayed effect on the incidence of rotavirus disease that is likely to be mediated by increases in transmission potential. The transmission of rotavirus is complex and it is unlikely that weather factors alone can fully explain the seasonality of rotavirus infections. Understanding the effects of weather factors on rotavirus disease could improve the accuracy of estimates for diarrhoeal burden of disease attributable to climate change. On a more practical level, knowing that there is a lag of at least one week between low temperature and an increase in reported rotavirus infections could help predict demands on health services and assist appropriate rationalization of healthcare resources.\\n\\n# References'),\n",

This study aimed to describe and compare the epidemiology of these infections in New Zealand, to better understand their impact on public health and to gain insight into their probable modes of transmission. We analysed cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis notification data for a 10-year period (1997–2006). Highest rates for both diseases were in Europeans, children aged 0–5 years, and those living in low-deprivation areas. Cryptosporidiosis distribution was consistent with mainly farm animal (zoonotic) reservoirs. There was a dose–response relationship with increasing grades of rurality, marked spring seasonality, and positive correlation with farm animal density. Giardiasis distribution was consistent with predominantly human (anthroponotic) reservoirs, with an important contribution from overseas travel. Further research should focus on methods to reduce transmission of Cryptosporidium in rural areas and on reducing anthroponotic transmission of Giardia.\\n\\nKey words: Anthroponotic, cryptosporidiosis, descriptive epidemiology, giardiasis, zoonotic.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCryptosporidium and Giardia are the most common causes of protozoan diarrhoea worldwide, and lead to significant morbidity and mortality in both the developing and developed world. Transmission is through the faecal–oral route following direct or indirect contact with the transmissive stages of the organism. Parasites, like Cryptosporidium and Giardia, can be transmitted from three sources: anthroponotic, zoonotic and sapronotic. Anthroponoses have an infectious human as source and inter-human transfer is typical. Zoonoses are diseases transmissible from animals to humans, in which inter-human transfer is uncommon. Sapronoses have an abiotic substrate as source.\\n\\nCryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis (previously known as C. parvum genotype 1: the human genotype) are the most commonly reported causes of human cryptosporidiosis. C. hominis appears to be a strictly human pathogen and is therefore subject to anthroponotic transmission. The reservoir of C. parvum includes all mammals, with cattle a major host. Zoonotic transmission is therefore considered a common transmission mode. Giardia duodenalis (synonyms: Giardia lamblia, Giardia intestinalis) is the only subspecies of Giardia found in humans, and is also found in the majority of domestic and wild mammals. There is extensive genetic variability within G. duodenalis.\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: Associate Professor M. G.

However, an earlier study\\nin the same region could not identify sheep as a source\\nof zoonotic     Giardia    and   Cryptosporidium       so the im-\\nportance of these animal reservoirs remains unknown\\n[9].

In\\nNew Zealand, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis be-\\ncame legally notifiable by diagnosing medical prac-\\ntitioners in mid-1996 so the first 10 years of notification\\ndata were available. The case definition requires a\\nclinically compatible illness with appropriate labora-\\ntory confirmation (detection of            C. parvum       oocysts\\nin faeces or    Giardia cysts, trophozoites or antigen in\\nfaeces). The Institute of Environmental Science and\\nResearch Ltd (ESR) collects these data under contract\\nto the Ministry of Health. In addition, data on hos-\\npitalization (principal diagnosis) from 1996 to 2006\\nwere    obtained      from     the    New     Zealand      Health\\nInformation Service (NZHIS), which is part of the\\nMinistry of Health. These conditions were coded as\\na cause of hospital admission (giardiasis : ICD-9-CM\\ncode 007.1 and ICD-10-AM code A07.1 from 1999\\nonwards ; cryptosporidiosis : ICD-9-CM code 136.8\\nand ICD-10-AM code A07.2 from 1999 onwards).\\nWe also reviewed published annual summaries of\\noutbreaks [11].\\n   To examine the potential role of environmental\\nsources, notified and hospitalized cases were desig-\\nnated as urban or rural based on their home address.\\nStatistics NZ classification which defines seven grades\\nof rurality, on the basis of the population number and\\nemployment status. Three of the categories are urban\\nand four are rural. The 2001 Census classified 85.7 %\\nof the population as ‘urban ’, and 14.3% as ‘ rural ’.\\n   The geographical distribution of cryptosporidiosis\\nand giardiasis in New Zealand was mapped using\\nArcGIS       at   Territorial    Authority      (TA)    level.   To\\nexamine potential zoonotic transmission, farm animal\\ndensity (total number of sheep, cattle, horses and\\ndeer per hectare of grassland) was determined for\\nevery TA and regressed to the disease rates. Farm\\nanimal     data    are   collected    by   Statistics   NZ    using\\nan Agriculture Production Census every 5 years. TA\\nlevel is the smallest area unit in which agricultural\\ndata are provided.\\n   The analyses were carried out using Epi-Info, SPSS\\nand Stata. Rates were calculated using population\\ndata from the 2001 Census, as this was in the middle\\nof the 10-year period of interest and therefore pro-\\nvided an appropriate denominator. Rates for ethnic\\ngroups (based on prioritized ethnicity [12]), sex and\\nurban/rural areas were directly age-standardized to\\nthe age distribution of the New Zealand population\\nin 2001 (using the age- standardizing method of Bray\\n[13]). Rate ratios (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals\\n(CI) were calculated using Stata.

Rates for males and females were similar for both diseases. The incidence was highest in Europeans (see Table 2).\\n\\n# Deprivation Levels\\n\\nThe rates of both diseases were inversely related to deprivation levels, with the highest rates in the least deprived areas. The deprivation index assigns a level on a decile scale based on census-derived measures, where level 1 represents the least deprived population and level 10 represents the most deprived (see Table 2).\\n\\n# Risk Factors\\n\\nCommonly reported risk factors included:\\n\\n- For giardiasis: untreated drinking water (35.3%), contact with symptomatic cases (34.9%), and recreational water (32.8%).\\n- Overseas travel during the incubation period was reported by 19.1% of cases for giardiasis, but only 5.7% for cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nFor cryptosporidiosis, the most reported exposure was contact with farm animals (59.4%).\\n\\n# Urban-Rural Distribution and Seasonal Patterns\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis showed marked seasonality, with 55% of cases occurring in spring (September–November) and only 11% in summer (December–February). A smaller late summer/early autumn peak was observed in urban areas in some years. Giardiasis exhibited little seasonality, with only a moderately elevated rate in autumn.\\n\\n# Animal Density\\n\\nAnalysis of average annual rates of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis per 100,000 population showed a small positive correlation with farm animal density for cryptosporidiosis, while giardiasis rates showed no correlation.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThis analysis indicates that cryptosporidiosis is primarily zoonotic, while giardiasis is predominantly anthroponotic. These differences have significant implications for disease prevention and control strategies.\\n\\n# Impact of Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis in New Zealand\\n\\nBoth diseases are relatively common, with annual notification rates of 22.0/100,000 for cryptosporidiosis and 44.1/100,000 for giardiasis, higher than those reported in other developed countries.

Cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis notification rates (average annual cases per 100,000 for 1997–2006) correlated with farm animal density (beef, sheep, horses, and deer per hectare in 2002) by territorial authority.\\n\\n# Economic Impact\\n\\nThe economic cost of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in New Zealand was about NZ$216 million in 2000. Cryptosporidium and Giardia result in approximately 2400 notified cases per year, leading to economic costs of around NZ$1.5 million annually (using an estimated cost per case of $599, based on the average cost of a case of intestinal infectious disease of $462 in 2000 updated to 2008).\\n\\n# Similarities in the Epidemiology of Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis in New Zealand\\n\\nHigh rates of both protozoan diseases were observed in infants and young children (0–9 years), a distribution common in other developed countries. Young children are more susceptible to parasitic infections and have more regular visits to a doctor, increasing the likelihood of diagnosis and notification.\\n\\nSurprisingly, high rates in Europeans for both diseases were noted, as Maori and Pacific people generally experience a higher incidence of infectious diseases in New Zealand. Notification data indicate an inverse relationship between these diseases and deprivation levels, which is unexpected as most infectious diseases are associated with socioeconomic deprivation. This may reflect poor access to primary health-care services by more deprived populations, including a disproportionate number of Maori and Pacific people.\\n\\n# Differences in the Epidemiology of Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis was strongly associated with living in rural areas, with rates about 2.8 times higher than urban populations. There was a small positive correlation with farm animal density, suggesting that farm animal reservoirs contribute to high rates in rural areas. C. parvum is dominant in rural areas, with cattle as a significant reservoir, indicating zoonotic transmission.\\n\\nRegions with the highest rates of cryptosporidiosis in the North Island have a concentrated dairy cattle farm industry, consistent with cattle being a source of human disease. However, the highest rates were found in the South Island, dominated by intensive sheep farming, suggesting that sheep may also be a source of infection.\\n\\nIn contrast, giardiasis rates showed only a weak relationship with rurality and no correlation with animal density, indicating that farm animals are not likely a major source of infection. Giardia is present in farm animals, but the extent of transmission to humans remains unclear. In rural New Zealand, both domestic and wild animals provide a significant reservoir of G. intestinalis cysts in areas with minimal human activity.\\n---\\n# Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis in New Zealand\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis in New Zealand\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis in New Zealand showed a striking seasonal pattern, with the largest number of notifications occurring in spring. The breeding season of both cows and sheep is during early spring. During this period, there is extended contact between humans (farmers) and (young) farm animals, which provides an opportunity for zoonotic transmission of C. parvum from young farm animals. It is known that only calves aged < 2 months are major hosts for C. parvum. Less than 1% of post-weaned and adult dairy cows excrete C. parvum oocysts in their faeces. These observations all support the important role of young animals as a source of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nBy contrast, giardiasis showed little seasonality which might suggest only a small contribution from zoonotic transmission. However, a recent study showed that G. intestinalis can be carried by adult animals. Therefore, G. intestinalis (including zoonotic subtype assemblage A) may be carried all year round in a proportion of adult farm and domestic animals, which could help explain the absence of seasonality in human disease.\\n\\nUntil 2001, there was also an autumn peak in cryptosporidiosis incidence in urban areas. This spatio-temporal pattern would be consistent with anthroponotic transmission of C. hominis through contaminated swimming pools. Another study in New Zealand reported that C. hominis is dominant during autumn, corresponding with the late part of the swimming season in this country. A swimming pool was also identified as the source for a large cryptosporidiosis outbreak in late summer/early autumn in 1998. The publicity following that outbreak may have contributed to improved regulations and filtration systems in public swimming pools resulting in the subsequent disappearance of this ‘swimming pool’ peak after 2001.\\n\\nPrevious studies on giardiasis in New Zealand concluded that seasonal patterns are present, with a late summer/early autumn peak (March/April). There was only a slight seasonal pattern visible in our data, with a relatively small increased risk for giardiasis in autumn (RR 1.17). We speculate that this higher risk may have been caused by anthroponotic transmission related to outbreaks from swimming pools, as was also seen with cryptosporidiosis. Similarly, this peak largely disappeared after 2001 presumably as a consequence of improved management of swimming pools.\\n\\nGiardiasis notifications showed high rates in people aged between 30 and 39 years. This age group is more likely to have contact with young children, as parents and/or caregivers, and therefore is more often involved with childcare and/or nappy handling. Contact with young children and nappies are known to be risk factors for giardiasis. This finding supports anthroponotic transmission.\\n\\nOur study found that notified cases of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis reported somewhat different patterns of exposures prior to becoming ill. The relative importance of these exposures has been investigated in a case-case analysis reported elsewhere. That analysis (using campylobacteriosis notifications as the comparison group) found significantly elevated crude odds ratios for giardiasis and overseas travel, whereas cryptosporidiosis was associated with contact with farm animals and sick animals. Both diseases had elevated risks associated with contact with sick people, human faecal matter, consumption of untreated drinking water and recreational water.\\n\\n# Implication for Prevention and Control'),\n",

Such measures could include general advice about hand washing after contact with farm animals and contaminated environments. Children should receive special attention, because disease risk appears so concentrated in this group. Parents and caregivers should be targeted during the spring period when disease risk is highest. Spread through water also requires monitoring. The New Zealand Ministry of Health should continue efforts to improve the quality of drinking-water supplies and operation of swimming pools to reduce the risk of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nPrevention of giardiasis should focus on measures to reduce person-to-person transmission. Based on existing evidence, such measures should include continuing efforts to improve hand washing, nappy handling, and other hygiene measures. Travel health advice relating to enteric infections may also be useful. As with cryptosporidiosis, continuing efforts to improve the quality of drinking-water supplies and operation of swimming pools are worthwhile strategies.\\n\\n# Limitations of this Analysis\\n\\nThis analysis has the limitations associated with the use of routinely collected surveillance data.

It is estimated that only 2.0% of AGI cases in New Zealand are eventually notified. In addition, descriptive data on their own have limited ability to identify the probable sources of infection. However, they may provide an indication of the relative importance of some sources, particularly if the distribution of cases is markedly different from that expected.\\n\\nNew Zealand Health Information Service supplied the hospitalization data. Jane Zhang extracted the hospitalization data and Simon Hales helped in the construction of the maps in ArcGIS.\\n\\n# Further Research\\n\\nThere is considerable potential to extend the simple univariate analyses presented here. A multivariate model could, for example, help to identify the separate contribution of ethnicity and deprivation to the observed giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis rates. Spatial analysis could also investigate how these diseases were related to animal density, drinking-water quality and other exposures of interest at a much finer level of spatial resolution.\\n\\nThe higher rates of cryptosporidiosis in rural areas deserve further investigation. Such research could focus on identifying the modes of transmission in this setting, particularly the relative importance of direct contact with farm animals and contaminated environments, and the role of contaminated drinking water. Future research is also needed to identify sources of the high burden of giardiasis in New Zealand, particularly since this finding cannot be attributed to the high numbers of farm animals in this country. Work by Hoque et al. identified environmental and social risk factors for giardiasis in New Zealand, although the exact sources remain unclear. While nappy changing was associated with a fourfold increased risk for giardiasis, this risk factor is unlikely to explain the high rates of infection in New Zealand. Further research on water supplies and water quality would also be useful to identify whether this source is important in New Zealand. Advances in molecular characterization of these parasites also have much to offer. For example, the use of a new generation of molecular diagnostic tools is likely to produce a more complete picture of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nThe Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd (ESR) supplied the notification data.\\n\\n# Declaration of Interest\\n\\nNone.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

However, outbreaks only account for a small percentage of all cryptosporidiosis cases and so the causes of the majority of cases are uncertain. This study assessed the role of environmental factors in all cases of cryptosporidiosis by using ordinary least-squares regression to examine the relationship between the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate, and the weather and river flows in England and Wales between 1989 and 1996. Between April and July the cryptosporidiosis rate was positively related to maximum river flow in the current month. Between August and November cryptosporidiosis was also positively linked to maximum river flows in the current month but only after accounting for the previous month’s temperature, precipitation and monthly cryptosporidiosis rate. No associations were found between December and March. Through an understanding of the environmental processes at work, these relationships are all consistent with an animal to human transmission pathway especially as the relationships vary throughout the year. This study therefore indicates the importance of an animal to human transmission pathway for all cases of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nKey words: cryptosporidiosis, Cryptosporidium, environment and public health, greenhouse effect, weather\\n\\n# Authors\\n\\nIain R.

Infected individuals have symptoms of gastro-enteritis which typically last from several days to several weeks, and in immune-compromised individuals, the disease can be fatal (Hunter & Nichols 2002). Worldwide cryptosporidiosis is widespread in many developed and developing countries (Hunter 2003) and was responsible for one of the largest waterborne outbreaks ever described in Milwaukee, USA, when over 400,000 people were allegedly infected (Lisle & Rose 1995). Seroepidemiological studies have detected anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies in 15 to 44% of the population in developed countries and more than 50% in developing countries (de Graaf et al. 1999), indicating that large numbers of the population have been exposed to Cryptosporidium.\\n\\nPeople become infected with Cryptosporidium through animal to human (Casemore et al. 1997; Pell 1997) and human to human transmission (Juranek 1995; Casemore et al. 1997), including via swimming pools (Dadswell 1996; Rose et al. 1997), and infected food and drink (Casemore et al. 1997; Nichols 2000). Studies of outbreaks (increases in cryptosporidiosis incidence investigated by public health officials) have demonstrated the importance of weather events (heavy precipitation and high river flows) in transmission through public and private water supplies (Lisle & Rose 1995; Curriero et al. 2001). However, in England and Wales around 92% of all cases are not linked to outbreaks.\\n\\ndoi: 10.2166/wh.2005.048\\n\\nDownloaded from https://iwaponline.com/jwh/article-pdf/3/4/469/396373/469.pdf\\n---\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Authors: I.

Lake et al.\\n\\nJournal: Journal of Water and Health | Volume: 3.4 | Year: 2005\\n\\nCases of cryptosporidiosis are not associated with a particular outbreak (Nichols & McLauchlin 2003) and so the causes of most cases are still uncertain. This study assesses the role of environmental factors in all (sporadic and outbreak related) reported cases of cryptosporidiosis by examining the association between the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate, weather, and river flows in England and Wales.\\n\\nCryptosporidium concentrations coinciding with heavy rainfall events (Casemore et al. 1997; Atherholt et al. 1998). Cryptosporidium is removed from potable water supplies by physical treatment (coagulation, sedimentation, and filtration (Rose et al. 1997)); thus outbreaks linked to drinking water usually result from a breakdown in the water treatment processes or an absence of adequate treatment (Lisle & Rose 1995).\\n\\n# Environmental Sources and Pathways of Transmission\\n\\nCattle and sheep are a significant source of Cryptosporidium for humans (Casemore et al. 1997; Sischo et al. 2000). Young animals are especially infectious, with infectivity declining with age as they develop immunity (Sischo et al. 2000).\\n\\nTransmission occurs through oocysts that are shed by the infected animal and once in manure it has been demonstrated that a high percentage of the oocysts can survive for over half a year (Robertson et al. 1992). From application to the land, the oocysts may be transferred into rivers but in order for this mobilisation to occur there need to be specific climatic and soil conditions, such as high precipitation falling onto saturated soils. Research has suggested that the leaching and runoff of Cryptosporidium from animal manures is a significant process by which Cryptosporidium can enter river water (Graczyk et al. 2000). This is strengthened by recent genetic typing studies which have shown that a large proportion of UK cryptosporidiosis cases are caused by the animal genotype (McLaughlin et al. 2000), suggesting an animal manure source.\\n\\nSewage effluent has also been recognised as a source of Cryptosporidium in rivers by a variety of authors (Graczyk et al. 2000; Roquet et al. 2000) and in the UK 40% of all Cryptosporidium cases may be sewage-related (McLaughlin et al. 2000). Once the Cryptosporidium has been washed into rivers the cool and moist conditions are ideal for its survival. However, the oocysts may not simply remain suspended in the water column but can pass into river sediments (Roquet et al. 2000) where they can survive for extended periods (Robertson et al. 1992) and be resuspended at a later stage.\\n\\nThe mechanisms for oocyst mobilisation, sedimentation, and resuspension may explain studies reporting peaks in cryptosporidiosis cases.\\n\\n# Figure 1\\n\\nNumber of cases of cryptosporidiosis per year, 1989–1996.\\n---\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Authors: I.

The data were analyzed using ordinary least-squares regression for each month, examining the relationship between the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate and the environmental variables.\\n\\nTo account for possible lagged relationships, variables indicating values for the three previous months were constructed. An auto-regressive term was included to account for correlation with the previous month’s rate.\\n\\nResults for individual months were combined based on similar seasonal patterns, leading to three time periods: April to July, August to November, and December to March.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe ordinary least-squares regression results indicated that from April to July, the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate was strongly associated with the maximum river flow for that month. Temperature and precipitation were not significant in the model. The model results are summarized in Table 1.\\n\\n|Variable|Coefficient|Significance|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Maximum River Flow|[Insert Coefficient]|Highly Significant|\\n|Temperature|[Insert Coefficient]|Not Significant|\\n|Precipitation|[Insert Coefficient]|Not Significant|\\n\\nWhen controlling for autocorrelation and seasonality, the maximum river flow remained highly significant.\\n---\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nAuthors: I.

From April to July, and especially during the early part of this time period, the increase in cryptosporidiosis may be due to the release of large numbers of newborn, and hence highly infectious, animals onto the land. At this time the land is usually saturated with water so any excrement and its accompanying Cryptosporidium is readily washed into watercourses, hence the strong link to the current month’s maximum river flow. This is supported by recent genetic typing work suggesting that the majority of cryptosporidiosis cases in the early part of the summer are infected with genotype 2 indicating a livestock source (Nichols & McLauchlin 2003).\\n\\nBetween December and March no significant associations were observed. The association with river flow may also be driven by the resuspension of Cryptosporidium from river sediments. Between August and November the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate is not significantly associated with maximum river flow. This variable only becomes significant once autocorrelation, and temperature and precipitation in the previous month have been accounted for, indicating that a less straightforward mechanism is at work. The importance of the autocorrelation term in the model suggests that secondary infections are of greater importance at this time of year. This is supported by results from genetic typing work suggesting that a large number of cryptosporidiosis cases in late summer and early autumn are caused by genotype 1 suggesting a human sewage source to the infection (Nichols & McLauchlin 2003).\\n\\n# Table 1: Ordinary Least-Squares Regression Model of Monthly Cryptosporidiosis Rate and Maximum River Flow Between April and July\\n\\n|Variable|Estimate|95% CI|t-value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Intercept|7.85|5.90 – 9.81|7.86|\\n|Current month’s maximum river flow (m3 s-1)|0.0614|0.0420 – 0.0809|6.20|\\n\\nr2: 54.7%\\n\\na Degrees of freedom 31; ppp p < 0.001; pp p < 0.05; pp p < 0.01.\\n\\nThe change in monthly cryptosporidiosis rate per unit change in the explanatory variable infection (Nichols & McLauchlin 2003).\\n---\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Weather and River Flow on Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nAuthors: I.

Together these associations imply that the monthly cryptosporidiosis rate is higher if the previous month is warm and relatively dry. Warm dry weather is associated with times when the soil moisture deficit is likely to be high and hence any Cryptosporidium falling onto the land is likely to build up on the fields and not be transferred to watercourses. Only when temperature and precipitation have been included in the model is the month’s maximum river discharge significant, implying that runoff is occurring and washing this build-up of Cryptosporidium into watercourses.\\n\\nIn the winter months, between December and March, many animals are housed indoors. This factor, combined with high precipitation, which would minimize the build-up of Cryptosporidium from any livestock which are on the land, is likely to lead to low Cryptosporidium concentrations in surface waters. Therefore, we would not expect cryptosporidiosis cases to be linked to weather events.'),\n",

Therefore, we would not expect cryptosporidiosis cases to be linked to weather events.\\n\\nThis paper has shown associations between all (sporadic and outbreak) cases of cryptosporidiosis and weather. The high explanatory power of the models combined with the observation that most cases are not outbreak related lead us to hypothesize that, in addition to outbreaks (Lisle & Rose 1995; Curriero et al. 2001), contaminated drinking water may be a significant source of sporadic cryptosporidiosis cases in England and Wales.\\n\\nA limitation of the study is that it was conducted at a national level averaging the large variations in weather and agriculture that occur across the country. This may be a particular problem in the summer when weather events can be very localized. Another limitation is that the observed association with environmental conditions may be the result of confounding by other factors not taken into account in this study. However, we have taken seasonal confounding into account as far as possible by looking at months separately and incorporating dummy variables of individual months into the ordinary least-squares regression models. Within these time periods we are not aware of any aetiological factors that would be strongly associated with the observed relationships with weather and river flow, so confounding does not seem likely.\\n\\nGlobal climate change will affect precipitation and temperature in the UK. Increases in temperature will lead to animals being released onto the fields earlier in the year possibly bringing forward the onset of the Cryptosporidium peak, which currently occurs in April. Summers and springs will be drier in the south-east and wetter in the north-west (Hulme & Jenkins 1998) and all areas are likely to see increased precipitation in the autumn and winter.

The opposite pattern may be observed in the north-west with more cases in the spring and early summer due to higher precipitation, and wetter summers and autumns leading to less build-up of Cryptosporidium in the environment possibly lowering cases of cryptosporidiosis in the August to November period. Our results indicate that higher winter precipitation is unlikely to have an impact on cases of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nHowever, these projected changes may be offset by the new legislation on Cryptosporidium in public water supplies, together with substantial increases in infrastructure investment by the water industry.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAdak, G.

Using a flexible Bayesian hierarchical framework, we identify previously undetected space-time clusters and environmental and socio-demographic risk factors for reported giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis at the New Zealand small area level. For giardiasis, there was no seasonal pattern in outbreak probability and an inverse association with density of dairy cattle (β = -0.09, Incidence Risk Ratio (IRR) 0.90 (95% CI 0.84, 0.97) per 1 log increase in cattle/km2). In dairy farming areas, cryptosporidiosis outbreaks were observed in spring. Reported cryptosporidiosis was positively associated with dairy cattle density: β = 0.12, IRR 1.13 (95% CI 1.05, 1.21) per 1 log increase in cattle/km2 and inversely associated with weekly average temperature: β = -0.07, IRR 0.92 (95% CI 0.87, 0.98) per 4°C increase. This framework can be generalized to determine the potential drivers of sporadic cases and latent outbreaks of infectious diseases of public health importance.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nSpatial, Temporal, Surveillance, Environmental, Outbreaks, Infections\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nGlobal environmental changes, especially climate change and human exploitation of productive ecosystems (1-3) have important implications for infectious disease risk (4, 5). For human pathogens with environmental reservoirs, such as livestock, understanding geographical and seasonal variability in risk factors can help to identify high risk locations and time-periods and predict disease incidence under scenarios of global environmental and social change (6, 7). New modelling tools can help to understand how these environmental and socio-demographic factors interact to drive disease patterns and translate this understanding to improve decision-making (8).\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis and giardiasis are infectious gastrointestinal diseases caused by the parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia (9). Cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis are recognized by the World Health Organization as infections of global importance (10), with high disease rates among children, the elderly, socio-economically disadvantaged and immune-suppressed people (11). The parasites are primarily spread through contaminated drinking or recreational water; however, infection in humans may arise through contaminated food, contact with animals, especially livestock or infected individuals (9, 10). In New Zealand, previous research on human cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis has suggested that local weather variability, socio-economic status and degree of urbanization are important determinants of spatial disease patterns (12, 13), while seasonal animal pathogen load and host behaviour influence temporal disease patterns (14-16).\\n\\nAs rates of reported cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in New Zealand continue to be higher than comparable rates in the United States (17) and Australia (18), identifying the environmental and socio-demographic exposures can help develop disease control priorities in high risk areas.\\n\\nWe used a Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework to identify space-time clusters of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in New Zealand and calculated an outbreak probability for each identified cluster. We then used a Bayesian spatio-temporal process model to identify the small area level environmental, socio-economic and demographic factors associated with the risk of reported disease.\\n\\n(1) Reference 1\\n\\n(2) Reference 2\\n\\n(3) Reference 3\\n\\n(4) Reference 4\\n\\n(5) Reference 5\\n\\n(6) Reference 6\\n\\n(7) Reference 7\\n\\n(8) Reference 8\\n\\n(9) Reference 9\\n\\n(10) Reference 10\\n\\n(11) Reference 11\\n\\n(12) Reference 12\\n\\n(13) Reference 13\\n\\n(14) Reference 14\\n\\n(15) Reference 15\\n\\n(16) Reference 16\\n\\n(17) Reference 17\\n\\n(18) Reference 18\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis in New Zealand\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Notification Data'),\n",

The reason for choosing this time period was that this was a period of rapid change in livestock farming across New Zealand, with an increase in dairy cattle numbers, decrease in number of farms and increase in stock density (Figure S1 Supplementary Material). Further, no major changes were made to the surveillance of these notifiable diseases from 1997–2007; direct laboratory notification began in 2008. For notifications, cases were defined as a clinical illness with appropriate laboratory confirmation. Based on home address, each notified illness was assigned a 2006 Census Area Unit (CAU) code. CAUs have a population of approximately 3000-5000 people.\\n\\nNearly all cryptosporidiosis cases (9848 out of 9900, 99.5%) and giardiasis cases (19470 out of 19553, 99.6%) were geocoded to a CAU.\\n\\n# Analysis of Risk Factors\\n\\nFor this analysis, notification data were restricted to the period 2000-2007 to match data on livestock densities and ensure that direct laboratory notification introduced in 2008 did not influence patterns. We extracted laboratory confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis (N=8688) and giardiasis (N=16930) along with the following case information: report date, age, prioritised ethnicity, and CAU code of residence. To avoid a “weekday effect” on notifications, cases were aggregated weekly where each week started on a Wednesday and ended on a Tuesday for every week in the eight year period.\\n\\n# Population at Risk\\n\\nWe obtained population estimates for census years 1996, 2001 and 2006. These data were linearly interpolated to produce population estimates across the study period. For the year 2007, the population estimates were extrapolated from the trend. The total population as well as the population by age group was provided where population estimates at 30 June 2000 were based on 2001 CAU boundaries, while population estimates from 2001 onwards were based on 2006 CAU boundaries. Using a geographic concordance file, the 2001 CAU boundaries were matched to the corresponding 2006 CAUs. Population was used as an offset to ensure that the case numbers were adjusted for the population at risk and population density was used as a.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Urban and Rural Analysis\\n\\n# Covariate Analysis\\n\\nIn the analysis to assess non-linear effects of density, population density was calculated by dividing the total population number in each CAU by the area in each CAU using ArcGIS v10.1.\\n\\n# Urban/Rural Residence\\n\\nFor each CAU, Statistics New Zealand categories classified 'main urban areas', 'satellite urban areas', and 'independent urban areas' as urban (reference category), whereas the categories 'rural areas with high urban influence', 'rural areas with moderate urban influence', 'rural areas with low urban influence', and 'highly rural/remote areas' were classified as rural.\\n\\n# New Zealand Deprivation Index\\n\\nWe estimated deprivation by CAU for study years by linear interpolation of the New Zealand Index of Deprivation (NZDep) for 2001 and 2006. Deprivation levels were grouped into terciles, with levels 1-3 representing affluent CAUs (Level 1) (reference category), 4-7 representing medium (Level 2), and 8-10 representing the least affluent CAUs (Level 3). These were fitted as a categorical variable.\\n\\n# Age and Ethnicity Estimates\\n\\nEthnicity estimates for the years 2001 and 2006 by CAU were provided by Statistics New Zealand and were based on 2006 CAU boundaries. For each major ethnic group, the percentage of the population number in each ethnic group to the total CAU population number of all ethnic groups in the CAU was calculated. The estimates for every year were calculated by linear interpolation of census years. For the year 2007, the population estimates were extrapolated from the trend. Ethnicity was based on Level 1 prioritised ethnicity which divides the population into European, Māori, Pacific Peoples, Asian, Middle Eastern/Latin American/African (MELAA), and Other. We estimated the proportion of the CAU population in each of three age categories (0-4; 5-64; and ≥65 years) based on interpolation of census data, as in a previous study.\\n\\n# Drinking Water Quality\\n\\nAnnual drinking water quality grading was supplied by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) Water Programme for the years 2000-2007. ESR used both the distribution zone code and protozoa compliance to construct a scoring system for drinking water quality. A distribution zone is defined as “all or part of a reticulated supply for which the water is expected to be of consistent quality throughout.” Protozoa compliance refers to compliance at the treatment plant and is based on monitoring the effectiveness.\\n\\nReferences: (20) ArcGIS v10.1, (21) Statistics New Zealand, (22) New Zealand Index of Deprivation, (23) Previous study, (24) Institute of Environmental Science and Research.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Drinking Water Quality and Disease Risk\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Drinking Water Quality and Disease Risk\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis research paper discusses the treatment processes used to remove or disinfect *Cryptosporidium* and evaluates drinking water quality across various regions.\\n\\n# Drinking Water Quality Assessment\\n\\nFollowing Brock (2011), a grid score of 0 denoted good drinking water quality (complied); a grid score of 1 denoted intermediate drinking water quality (inadequately monitored); a grid score of 2 represented poor drinking water quality (non-compliant and either not monitored or contained *E. coli*); and a grid score of 3 indicated the drinking water quality was unknown.

Livestock densities were calculated by dividing the number of animals in each CAU by the total land area in each CAU. Data for the missing years were interpolated. We included the logarithm of livestock density in the model as these data are skewed to the right (Figure S2). The method of assigning livestock numbers from each farm to a CAU is detailed in the Supplementary Material (Methods Section 2).\\n\\n# Climate Data\\n\\nWeekly time series of average temperature and rainfall for CAUs based on interpolated observations from land stations were provided by The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).

We assume the risk in time t + 1 is a linear extrapolation of risk at times t and t-1.\\n\\nRt+1 ~ Normal(2Rt - 2Rt-1, 2R)\\n\\nWhere sigma is the variance component of the normal distribution.\\n\\nRisk in spatial unit j is modeled as the average of risk in neighboring area units:\\n\\nUi ~ Normal(Uj, U2)\\n\\nWhere j is taken over the ni area units neighboring area unit i.\\n\\nNote that R, U, and W are treated as random effects, and thus account for overdispersion (Equation 1). In particular, the spatio-temporal component accounts for increased (or decreased) risk in a census area unit during each week and is designed to capture short-term localized periods of increased risk that are typical of outbreaks.\\n\\n# Outbreak Analysis\\n\\nFor the analysis of outbreaks and risk factors, the small island CAUs, those classified as harbors, inlets, and oceanic regions, and unpopulated CAUs were excluded. CAUs that had missing data for exposures of interest (such as urban/rural status, Deprivation Index) were also excluded. This resulted in a total of 1778/1927 (92%) of CAUs (mainland populations with all the covariates of interest) being included in the final analysis.\\n\\nThe model developed using Equation 2 was applied to each disease dataset to detect outbreaks clustered in time and space. In order to do this, Territorial Authorities (TAs, n=72) were used to group CAUs (n=1778) into regions. This reduced the number of parameters that needed to be estimated in the models and improved our ability to identify “outbreaks”, as they were based on several observations rather than a single datum.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Analysis of Risk Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\n.equation {\\nfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 10px;\\ndisplay: inline-block;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Analysis of Risk Factors for Cryptosporidiosis and Giardiasis\\n\\nThe model used for the analysis is defined by the following equation:\\n\\nWi,t = β( )Xritri( )\\n\\nWhere *i is the index of the region containing CAU i, tr is the outbreak indicator, and β reflects the size of the increase in risk for outbreaks in region r. The posterior proportion where β* = 1 thus gives the probability of an anomalous event. For detailed assessment of spatial and temporal patterns, one predominantly urban TA (Auckland) and one predominantly rural TA (Clutha) were chosen (Figure 1). Full details of this model, including priors and Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting scheme have been published (25).\\n\\n# Analysis of Risk Factors\\n\\nThe historical relationship between climatic, land use, and social factors with cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis incidence was analyzed using an extension of the outbreak model:\\n\\nWi,t = β1Z1,it + β2Z2,it + ... + βkZk,it\\n\\nWhere Z1,it, ..., Zk,it are explanatory covariates, such as weather, demographic, and environmental variables, and β1, ..., βk are coefficients to be estimated. Uninformative normal priors were specified for these coefficients.\\n\\nTo attain convergence, 4 separate chains of 100,000 iterations sampling every 50th iteration after an initial burn-in of 5000 iterations were run for each model. Having adjusted for the effect of other covariates, the change in incidence risk (IR) of each disease was calculated using the following equation:\\n\\nΔi,t = ekβ\\n\\nWhere Δi,t represents the change in the rate of a notified case of protozoan disease in grid *i during week t; and β* represents the posterior mean coefficient of each covariate. Model coefficients are related to incidence risk as follows: a change in temperature or rainfall equivalent to one standard deviation; for density variables, unit change on a log scale; for proportions (age, ethnicity), a change of one percent; for categorical variables (rurality, drinking water, deprivation) change compared to the baseline.\\n\\nFigure 1: Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Outbreaks\\n---\\n# Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Disease Risk\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Disease Risk\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the relative risks estimated by the spatial component of the model for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis across the whole country. The relative risk is interpreted as the risk of disease in each CAU as compared to the average risk across all units. Therefore, a value greater than 1.0 implies a higher than average risk, whereas a value less than 1.0 implies a lower than average risk.\\n\\nFigure 3: Relative risks estimated by the spatial component of the model for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in urban Auckland.\\n\\nThe relative risk of giardiasis was spatially heterogeneous, with many of the high-risk areas appearing along the coast (Figure 3A). In contrast, the relative risk of cryptosporidiosis notification in urban areas of Auckland was more uniform and was less than the average risk expected across all CAUs (Figure 3B).\\n\\nFigure 3C: Relative risks estimated for giardiasis in the rural Clutha region.\\n\\nFigures 3C and 3D show the relative risks estimated by the spatial component of the model for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in the rural Clutha region. In the rural Clutha District, the relative risk for giardiasis notifications was below the average estimated for all CAUs across the entire area (Figure 3C). Conversely, for cryptosporidiosis, the risk of notification was highest in the Clutha region as compared to the average expected risk (Figure 3D).\\n\\nFigure S3: Temporal trend of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis notifications across the study period.\\n\\nFigure S3 shows the temporal trend of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis notifications across the study period. For giardiasis, a decreasing trend until early 2000 was followed by a fairly consistent number of reported cases with seasonal fluctuations, but no distinct peaks. The trend for the average number of cryptosporidiosis cases remained fairly similar across the entire time period with clear dominant peaks in spring with two apparent autumn peaks in early years.\\n\\nFigure 4: Posterior outbreak probabilities for the Auckland and Clutha Districts for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis.\"),\n",

Figure S4 shows the increase in the estimated IRR of cryptosporidiosis relative to a baseline of 1 cow/km².\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nWe identified previously undetected clusters and estimated the independent effects of key physical and climate variables, environmental exposures, and demographic and socio-economic factors on the risk of infectious diseases monitored through routine surveillance. Neighbourhood environmental and social factors are associated with the risk of reported giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand, with distinct spatial and temporal patterns in plausible outbreaks. For both diseases, the risk of reported illness was negatively associated with the percentage of Asian, Māori, and Pacific Island ethnic groups, those over 65 years, and population density, and positively associated with the percentage of children up to 4 years old.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Giardiasis and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Spatial Patterns and Risk Factors of Giardiasis and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis research paper explores the spatial patterns and risk factors associated with giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, particularly in relation to dairy cattle density and urbanization.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nGiardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are significant enteric zoonotic infections with varying epidemiological patterns. This study aims to analyze the associations between these infections and environmental factors, including dairy cattle density and urban living conditions.\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\n# Giardiasis\\n\\nSpatial patterns in reported giardiasis suggest a higher risk in urban areas, with little seasonality in probable outbreaks. Giardiasis tends to be the least seasonal of the important enteric zoonotic infections globally. In New Zealand, meteorological conditions such as temperature and rainfall are not significantly associated with this enteric infection. A case-control study in Auckland identified changing nappies (diapers) as a significant risk factor. Increased risk has been noted in the age group of 30-39 years and in females, potentially due to closer associations with toddlers. Attendance at day care centers has frequently been cited as a common risk factor for giardiasis in children, supporting the hypothesis of higher risk in urban areas. Our findings indicate a significantly higher risk of reported giardiasis in children up to 4 years old.\\n\\n# Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nSpatial patterns in reported cryptosporidiosis suggest that environmental sources of infection dominate. The uniformly high risk patterns in the Clutha District, characterized by high dairy cattle densities, and the clear recurrent spring peaks in plausible outbreaks absent in urban regions imply a common environmental exposure likely related to agricultural activities, such as contact with newborn livestock. This conclusion is supported by a significant positive association of disease risk with dairy cattle density. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis have been reported following farm visits and among veterinary students in New Zealand. Genotyping of human and animal isolates suggests that sporadic cryptosporidiosis in rural areas is primarily driven by zoonotic transmission. Seasonal patterns may also be influenced by ambient environmental conditions affecting pathogen survival and transport, or the role of environmentally sensitive vectors such as flies.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nIn areas where dairy farming is predominant, the higher risk of reported cryptosporidiosis and seasonal patterns of outbreaks suggest an important role for environmental transmission. Ethnic and socio-economic disparities tend to reduce healthcare access and utilization by vulnerable populations, particularly at the primary care and laboratory diagnosis level. This effect limits the extent to which notification data may be used to infer causal relationships between disease risk and ethnic and socio-economic factors.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

For both diseases examined, the percentage of Asian, Māori, and Pacific Island ethnic groups in a given area was inversely associated with disease risk.

In the case of enteric salmonellosis, contrasting trends in hospitalizations for these ethnic groups suggest more severe outcomes for these populations (40).\\n\\nThe results of this study indicate that areas with higher socio-economic deprivation were inversely associated with the risk of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis (Table 1 and Table 2). This observation is likely an artifact of passive surveillance data. While high rates of reported cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis may be partially attributed to healthcare-seeking behavior, the highest hospitalization rates are also observed in these age groups, indicating a greater vulnerability to symptomatic disease.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this study builds on previous evidence by employing contemporary modeling methods and utilizing routinely collected surveillance data to identify localized, short-term periods of increased risk, as well as environmental, socio-economic, and demographic risk factors for infectious diseases. In New Zealand, the spatial and temporal variations in the risk of parasitic diseases appear to be quite distinct. By using an innovative Bayesian approach to detect spatially localized periods of increased disease incidence and identify associated environmental and socio-demographic exposures, this research provides crucial evidence to inform the development of targeted disease control measures in areas with high environmental health risks.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

Costa Rica recently started universal rotavirus vaccinations for infants with a two-dose schedule in February 2019. We aimed to study the seasonality of rotavirus during the pre-vaccination era. We retrospectively studied a six-year period of hospital admissions due to rotavirus gastroenteritis. We estimated seasonal peak timing and relative intensities using trend-adjusted negative binomial regression models with the δ-method. We assessed the relationship between rotavirus cases and weather characteristics and estimated their effects for the current month, one-month prior and two months prior, by using Pearson correlation coefficients. A total of 798 cases were analyzed. Rotavirus cases predominated in the first five months of the year. On average, the peak of admissions occurred between late-February and early-March. During the seasonal peaks, the monthly count tended to increase 2.5–2.75 times above the seasonal nadir. We found the strongest negative association of monthly hospitalizations and joint percentiles of precipitation and minimal temperature at a lag of two months (R = −0.265, p = 0.027) and we detected correlations of −0.218, −0.223, and −0.226 (p < 0.05 for all three estimates) between monthly cases and the percentile of precipitation at lags 0, 1, and 2 months. In the warm tropical climate of Costa Rica, the increase in rotavirus hospitalizations coincided with dry and cold weather conditions with a two-month lag. The findings serve as the base for predictive modeling and estimation of the impact of a nation-wide vaccination campaign on pediatric rotaviral infection morbidity.\\n\\nKeywords: rotavirus; children; acute gastroenteritis; seasonality; epidemiology; meteorology\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among children younger than 5 years in both developing and developed countries [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that rotavirus contributed 453,000 deaths within the global mortality of children <5 years in 2008 alone [2]. Prior to the introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006, approximately 15,000 deaths, 75,000...\\n\\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

In Costa Rican children, rotavirus is the leading cause of acute viral diarrhea, accounting for 53% of rotavirus-positive stool samples predominantly with the G3 strain [4].\\n\\nRotavirus seasonality has been shown to differ widely across the world. In 1990, Cook et al. reported that rotavirus was common in colder months in temperate regions with a distinct winter peak in the Americas, different seasonal peaks in other temperate regions, and no distinct seasonality in the tropics [5]. A more recent meta-analysis shows that in the tropical belt, rotavirus cases have a lower seasonal intensity compared to more northern or southern latitudes, where prevalence peaks in winter months (November-April and May-October, respectively) [6]. In South Asia, the highest rate of rotavirus was seen in the colder, drier months [7]. In humid mid-latitude climates, low temperature and precipitation levels were significant predictors of an increased rate of rotaviral diarrhea. A 1°C decrease in monthly ambient temperature and a decrease of 10 mm in precipitation were associated with a 1.3% and 0.3% increase above the annual level in rotavirus infections, respectively. The relationships with temperature and precipitation in the previous month were strongest in the tropical climate [7].\\n\\nMany authors have analyzed the association between rotavirus seasonality and weather parameters. Relationships between monthly rotavirus incidence and climatological variables, such as temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity, suggest that rotavirus infections tend to increase under cool and dry conditions in temperate [8] and tropical regions [7, 9–13]. In contrast, rotavirus peaks often align with monsoon seasons in tropical settings [9]. This may be due to wider dispersal of the virus in floodwater, where contamination promotes infections with numerous enteric viruses, including rotavirus [14, 15]. Kraay et al. demonstrated that in tropical climates, water sources play an important role in the environmental transmission of rotavirus at both the community and regional scales [16]. Environmental transmission risks may also be affected by temperature, river flow velocity, water sanitation, hygiene interventions, and water reservoir size [16]. It is likely that distinctly different seasonal patterns of rotavirus disease in locations with similar climate and level of development indicate a variety of factors affecting disease seasonality [6].\\n\\nSince 2006, two rotavirus vaccines have been licensed in over 100 countries worldwide. By the end of 2014, more than 70 countries had introduced the rotavirus vaccine into their routine childhood immunization programs [1]. Effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines against hospitalizations and severe diarrhea in Latin American children has been approximately 70%, with notable reductions in mortality rates in Brazil, Mexico, and Panama where the vaccination coverage was over 80% [17]. Until recently, Costa Rica and Belize were the only two countries in Central America without universal rotavirus vaccination [18,19]. Costa Rica just started universal rotavirus vaccination with a two-dose schedule in February 2019. Age of first infection, strain distribution, the occurrence of mixed infections, seasonality, and risk of mortality can affect decisions about vaccine composition and delivery [20]. Understanding the seasonality of rotavirus in Costa Rica can help inform vaccination scheduling and resource management.\\n\\n# 2. Data and Methods\\n\\n# 2.1.

Introduction\\n\\nSeguro Social (CCSS), located in San José, Costa Rica. This city is both the nation’s capital and most populated province, receiving patients from all over the country, as it is part of the public health system. Its main population capture area is localized in the Central Valley, which includes the urban centers of San Jose, Heredia, Alajuela, and Cartago.\\n\\nAnnual weather patterns are often described by the rainy and dry season due to Costa Rica’s location in the tropical belt 9.7489º north of the equator. A mountain system divides the country into two hillsides, each with a different precipitation and temperature regimen following unique temporal distributions. The Central Valley is located on the west side of this mountain range, characterized by an annual mean temperature ranging from 19 to 22°C, a relative humidity of 82%, precipitation ranging from 1500 mm to 2500 mm, and an average elevation of 1200 m above sea level. The region’s dry season consistently occurs between December and March, while the rainy season is between May and October (April and November serve as transition months between seasons).\\n\\n# 2. Health Outcomes\\n\\nFor this six-year retrospective analysis, the hospital admissions due to acute rotavirus gastroenteritis were retrieved from January 2010 to December 2015. Selection criteria included: (i) children less than 13 years of age, and (ii) laboratory-confirmed episode of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis among hospitalized patients. A physician evaluated all children with diarrhea who presented at the hospital.\\n\\nAccording to the child’s hydration state, he/she was either treated with oral rehydration as ambulatory patients or admitted and hydrated orally or intravenously in observation rooms. Those with severe dehydrating diarrhea or shock were transferred immediately to the emergency room. The last two categories (admitted to observation or emergency rooms) were considered as hospitalized patients. All nosocomial rotavirus infections were excluded from the analysis.\\n\\nPatients were identified retrospectively both from the microbiology laboratory database and by the Center’s Statistics and Medical Records Division. The patient’s clinical charts and laboratory reports were reviewed with respect to the inclusion criteria of the study. Rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as three or more watery stools in 24 h, with or without vomiting and/or fever, with symptoms starting less than 15 days before admission. Patients also had to have a positive rapid antigen test performed within 48 h of admission. The VIKIA®Rota-Adeno immune-chromatography technique was used for diagnostic confirmation.\\n\\n# 3. Meteorological Data\\n\\nWeather data maintained by the National Meteorological Institute of Costa Rica was abstracted from monthly reports collected from 15 weather stations located in the Central Valley. Precipitation values were reported as monthly cumulative averages from thermo-pluvial-metric weather stations in the central region. Temperature values were reported as monthly averages of maximal and minimal temperatures from the same weather stations.\\n\\n# 4. Statistical Analysis\\n\\nAll eligible hospitalization records were compiled into monthly time series of counts. We used two approaches to estimate seasonal peaks. First, seasonal peaks were defined as one or two consecutive months with the highest number of positive rotavirus tests in a given year. The onset of rotavirus season was defined as the first month when the number of monthly cases exceeded the overall median, and the duration of the season was defined as the number of months with positive results exceeding the median.\\n\\nNext, to improve the estimation precision, we estimated seasonal peak timing, relative intensities and their 95% confidence intervals for all children, as well as younger (<24 months) and older.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Rotavirus and Weather Characteristics\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n.equation {\\nfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\\nbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder-left: 3px solid #3498db;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Cases and Weather Characteristics\\n\\nThis study investigates the relationship between monthly counts of laboratory-confirmed rotaviral infections and various weather characteristics.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nWe estimated peak timing and its variance using trend-adjusted Negative Binomial regression models with the δ-method, as follows:\\n\\nln[E(Ytj)] = β0 + βtt + βs(sin(2πωt)) + βc(cos(2πωt))\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- Ytj – rotavirus cases for t-month if j-age group;\\n- t – refers to a time series indicating the consecutive study month from one to 72;\\n- sin(2πωt) and cos(2πωt) refer to two periodic terms defining seasonal oscillations with a frequency of ω = 1/12, representing the length of the annual cycle in months.\\n\\nThe estimates of βs and βc regression coefficients and their error values were used to calculate seasonality characteristics: peak timing and relative intensity, e.g., the ratio between the predicted maximum and minimum counts.\\n\\n# Weather Characteristics Assessment\\n\\nTo assess the relationship between rotavirus counts and weather characteristics, we first examined the distribution of each meteorological variable. We identified suitable transformations and informative lags, or the time delay between the seasonal peak in rotavirus and the meteorological variables.\\n\\nThe distribution of monthly precipitation values appeared to be left-skewed. Thus, they were examined as percentile values in decimal continuous form ranging between 0 and 1. We determined the cut point of 26.8 mm (the 25th percentile) of precipitation to define the local dry period. Similarly, local cold conditions were designated when the average minimum temperature dropped below 16.2°C (the 25th percentile).\\n\\nFigure 1. Scatter plots illustrating relationships between monthly precipitation values and their percentiles (A), monthly temperature values and their percentiles (B), and the joint percentiles for mean minimum temperature and precipitation identifying the cold and dry regiment (C), for 2010–2015 in the Central Valley of Costa Rica.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nCorrelations were estimated between the joint percentile for precipitation and monthly hospitalization counts using Pearson correlation coefficients. We repeated the calculations for temperature for the current month, one month prior, and two months prior (or at lag 0, 1, and 2) with children <24 months and children ≥24 months. These estimations allowed us to provide a robust and comprehensive assessment of the associations.\\n\\nThe data compilation and analysis were completed using Epidata 3.1, Excel 2011, IBM SPSS Statistics version 21, and Stata 15.\\n\\n# Ethical Approval\\n\\nThe study was approved by the hospital’s bioethics and research committee.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Results\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nA total of 798 patients met the inclusion criteria during the six-year period.

However, monthly counts of hospitalizations vary by year. The rotavirus season in 2010 started in October (with a sporadic spike in June) and extended through the first two months of 2011. The rest of the year 2011 presented with no marked season and the least amount of cases compared with the other years. In 2012, the rotavirus season started in April and extended to August, with the peak season in May, which also was the month with the highest average precipitation in that year. This was an atypical year with respect to rotavirus incidence with most of the months having 6 or more cases. In 2013 and 2015, the rotavirus season lasted from January to April, and from January to May, respectively. The peak season in 2013 was in January and in 2015 was in March. Both peaks coincided with the months with the least precipitation. In 2014, the rotavirus season lasted from March to May with the peak of cases occurring in March. This variability is reflected by high values of the standard deviation for January and May (Table 1).\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Rotavirus Hospitalizations and Environmental Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.caption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Hospitalizations and Environmental Factors in Costa Rica\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the relationship between environmental factors and rotavirus hospitalizations in the Central Valley of Costa Rica from 2010 to 2015.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Hospitalizations and Environmental Characteristics\\n\\nFigure 2.

Discussion\\n\\nAlthough previous studies about rotavirus gastroenteritis among Costa Rican children have analyzed the monthly distribution of cases and peak timing during the year, we have provided a comprehensive analysis correlating rotavirus infection to three meteorological characteristics. As in previous local reports [26], we found a predominance of cases in the first half of the year, which locally coincides with dry and cold weather. For all but one year, cases increase between November and March, similar to the rotavirus season in the northern latitudes as reported by other authors [6]. On average, hospitalizations peaked between late February and early March, following or coinciding with the local dry weather in January, February, and March. Hieber and co-authors reported this phenomenon in the same study area more than 30 years ago [26]. Unusually, the rotavirus season of 2012 lasted from May to August and overlapped with the southern latitudes, coinciding with the rainiest months.\\n\\nThe negative associations between rotavirus incidence and meteorological variables have already been reported in multiple studies run in both tropical and temperate areas [7–13]. In a similar tropical climate, in the city of Caricuao in Venezuela, a 6-year study in the pre-vaccine era demonstrated the year-round presence of rotaviral infection with a slight decrease during the wet and warm months [27]. A three-year surveillance study in Western Kenya with a predominantly tropical climate showed that stool samples collected during warm and dry months were twice as likely to be rotavirus-positive as compared to cool and rainy months, yet inconsistent across the years [28]. A meta-analysis of 26 studies conducted in the tropical climate between 1975 and 2003 demonstrated an inverse significant relationship between monthly rotavirus incidence and climatological variables such as temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity [6]. Unlike most of these published studies, we found a significant correlation at a two-month lag, indicating the delayed effects of cold and dry conditions on rotavirus incidence. Other authors have reported negative lagged correlations between rotavirus and both temperature and precipitation. Jagai and co-authors demonstrated that, in tropical and temperate regions of South Asia, rotavirus rates were the highest in the colder, drier months, based on negative significant relationships between rotavirus cases and temperature, precipitation, and vegetation index. The associations were prominent at no lag and one-month lag, yet strongest at one-month lag [7]. Hasan et al. recently analyzed rotavirus diarrheal risk due to hydroclimatic extremes and found that during the winter season, the rotavirus outbreak in Dhaka had similarly strong negative one-month lagged correlations with rainfall-related indices [29].\\n\\nNumerous environmental, behavioral, and immunological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the seasonality of viral pathogens [30]. It is important to keep in mind that seasonal factors operate through many transmission mechanisms making it difficult to define an exclusive causal pathway. The issue of co-seasonality of numerous environmental, social, and behavioral phenomena may also influence the reproductive number of infectious diseases [30]. The influence of climatologic factors directly on rotavirus survival and infectivity is one example. Rotavirus survival is favored by cooler conditions with low humidity [6]. Given the characteristics of transmission of the virus (by fecal/oral route and by respiratory droplets), it has been hypothesized that a relative drop in humidity and rainfall combined with the drying of soils might increase the aerial transport of dried, contaminated fecal material [6]. At the same time, rotavirus can retain its infectivity for several days in aqueous environments and remain viable on inanimate surfaces when dried from fecal suspension [31]. Thus, these environmental phenomena may best be correlated with rotavirus infection using 1–2-month lag as proposed by some authors [7,29] and shown in our analysis.\\n\\nWhile many studies consider indirect transmission through water negligible when analyzing rotavirus transmission dynamics or were not able to accommodate this information, this form of environmental transmission may pose an important risk in tropical climates [16]. This could explain why rotavirus peaks weakly correlate with the rainiest months. Different weather variables can also influence human behavior, sanitation, hygiene practices and the probability of environmental exposures. For example, rainfall can encourage individuals to stay indoors, altering the pattern of contact between infected and susceptible individuals.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Seasonality in Costa Rica\\n\\nIn addition, research has suggested that annual epidemics or pandemics of different viral infections can interfere with each other, but clear trends over a long time and underlying mechanisms are unknown [32]. Although the additional mechanisms of transmission are beyond the scope of this paper, it is important to note that Costa Rica had a sanitation alert due to the first wave of H1N1 influenza (swine flu) on April 2009. In 2010, rotavirus peaked late in October, followed by very few cases in 2011, which was the year with the least number of cases. During this period, numerous sanitary measures, including prolonged school closures and the suspension of national gatherings, were undertaken and maintained. Also, there was great exposure in social media of preventive hygiene measures that should be followed to reduce the risk of acquiring the disease.

Also, there was great exposure in social media of preventive hygiene measures that should be followed to reduce the risk of acquiring the disease. Nevertheless, improvements in hygiene or sanitation have not proven to substantially reduce the burden of rotavirus disease [31].\\n\\nThis study did not analyze the genotypes of rotavirus strains, but strain distribution and variability can also be responsible for rotaviral outbreaks and changes in seasonal patterns. Previous investigations in our center had demonstrated that there was a great diversity of G and P genotypes circulating simultaneously with a frequent occurrence of unusual G-P combinations. Bourdett-Stanziola and co-authors analyzed rotavirus genotypes in Costa Rica from December 2002 to July 2003 and found that the most prevalent combination was G3P [8] (54% prevalence) [33]. A few years later, that same author analyzed rotavirus genotypes between August and October of 2005, and between May and June of 2006 and found G1P [8] and G9P [8] as the most prevalent combinations in each period, respectively [34].\\n\\nUndoubtedly, vaccination against rotavirus is the best measure to prevent rotavirus disease. While the rotavirus vaccine had not been introduced in Costa Rican universal immunization program at the time of the study, it has been available in private practice. As this was not measured, immunization programs may have covered a minor fraction yet unknown percentage of our population. Our study provides the benchmark for seasonality of hospitalizations in the main pediatric center in the pre-vaccine period. We will compare these findings with the post-vaccination variations. We expect changes in seasonal patterns after universal vaccine implementation, including delays in the start of rotavirus season, shorter duration of seasons, and blunting of seasonal peaks [35-38]. The presented model for estimating the peak timing will allow us to monitor changes in disease incidence.\\n\\nDemographic structures also influence the seasonality pattern. We expect that by studying seasonal patterns in different age groups will help to describe changes in rotavirus incidence associated with vaccination. For example, in Finland, rotavirus infection was most common in children <5 years of age before vaccine introduction, but after the vaccine was introduced, the main age groups affected by rotavirus were children between 6–16 years of age and individuals >70 years of age [39]. Studies suggest that higher birth rates have been related to the lack of seasonality [40]. In a birth cohort study, the effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence, showing a strong negative association, yet seasonality was well maintained [41].\\n\\nFinally, seasonality in the tropics may also be driven by very complex weather conditions not measured in our study, like wind patterns [42]. Costa Rica is located under the influence of the inter-tropical convergence zone and equatorial winds [43]. The presence of natural phenomena, like ENOS (El Niño Southern Oscillation), which is the most dominant source of inter-annual climatic variability in the Tropics [44], may influence the seasonality of different infectious agents. In June 2010, a strong La Niña pattern had started and was described as the most intense in the last 30 years. This pattern resulted in a mild increase in average precipitation in the Central Valley, lasting until February 2012. In April 2014, the region experienced a low-intensity El Niño pattern, which by May 2015 had intensified and lasted for the whole year [45]. The associations between diarrheal diseases and El Niño pattern were noted in other studies. For example, Checkley et al. reported a 200% increase in the daily number of expected admissions for diarrheal diseases of Peruvian children during the El Niño episode in 1997–1998 [46].\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3, h4 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Limitations\\n\\nWe acknowledge limitations of our study. First, because of its retrospective nature, we lacked important patients’ individual information, including exact home address, socioeconomic status, water supply, and overcrowding conditions. Second, we only examined the correlation between rotavirus and two weather variables. There is some variability in measuring precipitation across weather stations, however, it is unlikely that such variability affects our findings. The study site is located in the central region, one of the seven national climatic regions, and has a high density of thermo-pluvio-metric stations with the most reliable meteorological monitoring in the country. Furthermore, the detected peak of rotavirus hospitalizations occurred during dry months, when the amount of precipitation (and thus, its variability) is low. In locations with a limited ground meteorological network, satellite imagery could be used as the proxy. Otherwise, we recognize a dual benefit of using data from local authorities. First, it signals to the weather forecast community that their information is of a high value to public health professionals. On the other hand, the public health community could be more proactive in working with local forecasters on delivering key warning messages in a timely manner.\\n\\nWe analyzed only children with rotavirus requiring hospital admissions and therefore the majority of less severe cases were not included. We may have also missed rotavirus-associated diarrhea hospitalizations, as we didn’t analyze all-cause diarrhea hospitalizations. Lastly, we examined cases from a single center, however, due to Costa Rica’s size and the hospital’s population catchment areas, these findings probably reflect similar conditions in other parts of the country. A better understanding of pathogen-specific infection seasonality is essential to target local and national health policies as well as design and implement well-tailored preventive strategies to control rotaviral infections especially when suitable vaccines are available.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nAt the main pediatric hospital in Costa Rica, there is a higher prevalence of rotavirus acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in the first half of the year, with an average peak between late-February and early-March. During seasonal peaks, the counts are expected to increase 2.5–2.75 times higher than the seasonal nadir. In a warm tropical climate of Costa Rica, we observed significant inverse correlations between rotavirus admissions and cold and dry weather conditions with a two-month lag. With the routine assessment of temporal trends of potentially preventable infections and their seasonal uptakes, we will be able to better assess the effect of a broad implementation of vaccination and relevant prevention measures.\\n\\n# Author Contributions\\n\\nConceptualization, K.U.-C., R.U.-G. and A.M.-G.; data curation, K.U.-C., S.Á., M.G. and E.N.N.; formal analysis, K.U.-C. and E.N.N.; investigation, K.U.-C., S.Á., M.G. and E.N.N.; methodology, K.U.-C. and E.N.N.; visualization, R.U.-G. and A.M.-G.; writing—original draft, K.U.-C. and A.M.-G.; writing—review & editing, E.N.N. and R.U.-G.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nThe authors received no specific funding for this work.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors thank Ryan Simpson, from the Nutrition Data Sciences Division at Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, for his contribution to the statistical analysis and editing.\\n\\n# Conflicts of Interest\\n\\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

From May 2017 to November 2018, we visited ten reservoirs and a river in the Anseong region of South Korea and collected a total of 192 samples in accordance with the environment protection agency guidelines. We recorded the weather factors (temperature, humidity, and accumulated precipitation) and investigated the surrounding environment factors (livestock, fishing site, the catchment area of reservoirs, etc.). Our research results show that from the river and reservoirs, the detection rates of human norovirus GII, adenovirus, rotavirus, human norovirus GI, and astrovirus were 27.1, 10.4, 10.4, 4.16, and 3.1%, respectively. Their viral load ranged from −1.48 to 1.55 log10 genome copies/l. However, hepatitis A virus was not detected in any irrigation water sample. Although no sampling was performed in winter, foodborne viruses and male-specific coliphages were frequently found during spring (40.78%) and autumn (39.47%). Interestingly, the significant correlation between the accumulative precipitation and the number of detected norovirus and adenovirus was confirmed by linear regression analysis. Furthermore, when the accumulative precipitation ranged from 20 to 60 mm, it significantly affected the viral load and prevalence. Among the environmental factors, recreational facilities such as fishing sites and bungalow fishing spots were identified as contamination sources by correlation analysis. Our research results confirmed the correlations between environmental contamination factors in the reservoir and weather factors with the prevalence of foodborne viruses in the reservoir. These facilitate the assessment of potential foodborne virus contamination during crop irrigation. In addition, predictive models including environmental and weather factors should be developed for monitoring and controlling the safety of irrigation waters in reservoirs.\\n\\nKeywords: norovirus; adenovirus; reservoir; contamination; precipitation; drought\\n\\n# 1.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that extreme weather events, including heavy rains and droughts, are likely to occur at higher frequencies in several countries.

A severe drought impacted the Korean peninsula in 2017, affecting agricultural farms, including those in Gyeonggi province.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nReservoirs play an important role in supplying irrigation water, especially during periods of frequent water utilization. South Korea has a total of 3,049 reservoirs that serve as sources of irrigation water and supply water during droughts. Complex factors, including weather and local environment, can affect the water quality of reservoirs. Urban sewage, manure fertilizers, livestock farms, and industrial production have been shown to contaminate irrigation water. Among weather factors, heavy rains and floods can significantly affect the severity of irrigation water contamination. Droughts have also been shown to result in 100-fold higher concentrations of pathogens in surface waters, thus altering water quality.\\n\\nThe contamination of irrigation water with bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa is detrimental to public health. Utilization of contaminated irrigation water can cause pathogens to attach to the cut surfaces of leafy greens through the stoma and result in their accumulation in fresh produce through water absorption by roots. Agricultural farms obtain irrigation water from various sources, such as reservoirs, rivers, and groundwater, making them susceptible to pathogenic contamination of fresh produce and fruits. In recent decades, contaminated fresh produce and fruits have been associated with viral gastroenteritis. These results suggest that irrigation water safety is closely associated with food safety. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate contamination sources and determine the relationships between the prevalence of foodborne viruses in reservoirs and weather and environmental factors.\\n\\n# Foodborne Viral Infections\\n\\nFoodborne viral infections exert a significant economic burden globally. Human norovirus (HuNoV), human adenovirus (AdenoV), human astrovirus (AstroV), and human rotavirus (RotaV) frequently cause acute viral gastroenteritis characterized by abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are associated with acute hepatitis and jaundice. The first reported outbreaks of foodborne gastroenteritis in school children in Korea occurred in 2004 and were associated with HuNoV. Subsequently, 50 viral foodborne outbreaks and 1,211 patients have been reported annually (2012 to 2018) by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in Korea. Furthermore, Korea has reported frequent HAV, RotaV, AdenoV, and AstroV outbreaks. Although groundwater contamination by HuNoV and HAV was confirmed as the cause of several outbreaks in Korea, the prevalence of foodborne viruses in reservoirs in Korea has not been previously reported.\\n\\n# Study Objective\\n\\nThis study aimed to monitor pathogenic foodborne viruses (HuNoV, AdenoV, AstroV, HAV, and RotaV) and indicator microorganisms (including male-specific coliphages) in reservoirs in South Korea for a duration of 18 months. Furthermore, the relationships between the prevalence of foodborne viruses in reservoirs and various environmental and weather factors were analyzed.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Sampling Sites and Sample Collection\\n\\nAnseong is a city surrounded by many agricultural farms, with a population of 184,287.

Virus Concentrations and RNA Extraction\\n\\nA total of 192 irrigation water samples were collected every two months from May 2017 to November 2018 and subsequently examined for viruses (96 samples) and indicator microorganisms (96 samples). However, sampling was not conducted from January 2018 to February 2018 due to surface freezing of the reservoirs. Samples were not collected from the Anseong River (site K) in March 2018 due to a temporary ban on access to this area to prevent the regional outbreak of avian influenza.\\n\\nThe surface irrigation water samples were collected following the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines [31]. Each sampler comprised a flow meter, a pressure gauge, tubing, a cartridge filter housing, and Koshin Hidels Pump (Model: SE-25L) [32]. Approximately 300−350 L of water samples were filtered (10 L/min) using a pre-filter (FROM-10 Deluxe Sediment Filter Cartridge Set). Subsequently, viral particles were concentrated on a 1-MDS electropositive cartridge filter (10 micron, 3M, USA) [32]. Thereafter, the pre-filter was discarded and the secondary 1-MDS filter was either retained in the cartridge housing for immediate estimation of viral concentrations or stored at 4 °C.\\n\\nFor indicator microorganisms detection, a 250 mL sterilized water sampling bottle was utilized for irrigation water collection directly from the reservoirs and river. Then, refrigerated and shipped to the laboratory. Samples were analyzed within 24 h after collection.\\n\\nFigure 1. Geographical locations of ten reservoirs and Anseong River (site K) in Gyeonggi province, South Korea. Site K is characterized by the downstream merging of sites C and D. Fishing sites and bungalow fishing spots represent recreational facilities.\\n\\nVirus concentrations were determined by the virus adsorption-elution (VIR-AD-EL) technique from the previous study [32]. Initially, 10 μL of MNV-1 as an internal process control was added in 0.5 L of a beef extract solution (1.5% beef extract, 0.05 M glycine, pH = 9.5) to assure the virus recovery. Subsequently, the cartridge housing of each sample was filled with 0.5 L of a beef extract solution by using a peristaltic pump and soaked for 5 min. The above-mentioned process was repeated once. The eluates were adjusted to a pH of 3.5 by using 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl). Subsequently, the elutes were centrifuged at 2500× g at 4 °C for 15 min. Thereafter, the supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was resuspended in 30 mL of a 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4, pH = 9.0~9.5: Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1224\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThe precipitate was resuspended in 30 mL of a 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4, pH = 9.0~9.5: Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The supernatant was centrifuged (Beckerman Coulter, Avanti J-E centrifuge, Indianapolis, IN, USA) at 7000x g at 4 °C for 10 min and transferred to a new collection tube. The pH was adjusted to 7.0–7.5 using 1 M HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, Billerica MA, USA, CAS Number: 7647-01-0). Then, the concentrated 30 mL water samples were filtered through a 0.45-μm-pore-size syringe filter (Biofact, Daejeon, Korea, Cat. No. BSS45-CA25) to prevent microbial contamination. Ten mL of the filtered samples were concentrated again to 1 mL using Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) with a molecular-weight cutoff of 10 kDa. Furthermore, RNA extraction was performed for a 500 μL aliquot of the concentrated sample according to manufacturer’s instructions (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The total nucleic acid was eluted with 70 μL of RNase-free water. The extracted nucleic acids were immediately analyzed, and the leftover solution was stored at −80 °C.\\n\\n# Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (Real-Time RT-qPCR)\\n\\nPrimers and probes utilized for the seven viruses (HuNoV GI, HuNoV GII, HAV, RotaV, AstroV, AdenoV, and murine norovirus (MNV-1)) and the amplification conditions are listed in Table 1. Real-time qPCR and real-time RT-qPCR were performed using the Takara TP800 Thermal Cycler Dice™ real-time system and Bio-Rad CFX96TM C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler real-time system, respectively. Viral genome was amplified in a 25 μL reaction mixture containing 5 μL of each sample RNA, 12.5 μL of a 2 × QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN, Germany), 0.25 μL of a QuantiTect RT Mix, 500 nM of a forward and reverse primer, and 250 nM of probe. Quantification was performed by using the commercial quantitative synthetic viral RNA (HuNoV GI, ATCC® VR-3234SD™; GII, ATCC® VR-3235SD™; HAV, ATCC® VR-3257SD™; RotaV, ATCC® VR-2018DQ™; AstroV, ATCC® VR-3238SD™; MNV, ATCC® VR-3255SD™). Quantitative DNA fragment of AdenoV was synthesized using Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). The calculation of virus recovery by using of MNV-1 in this study was based on the previous study. The sample was prepared again if the extraction efficiency of MNV-1 was less than 1%. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated for the original volume of filtered water (LOD = (volume of final concentrated retentate × volume of eluate from nucleic acid extraction × volume of nucleic acid template added to the PCR reaction/volume of recovery efficiency from filtration × volume of original water samples)).\\n\\n# Table 1.

Male-Specific Coliphage Isolation, Aerobic Plate Count (APC), and Coliform Count\\n\\nMale-specific coliphages were isolated using the US Environmental Protection Agency method 1601 [42]. The enrichment of male-specific coliphages (obtained from the reservoir water samples) was conducted by mixing 100 mL of each sample with 1.25 mL of stock magnesium chloride (MgCl2), 0.5 mL of log-phase *Escherichia coli Famp (ATCC 700891), 5 mL of 10 X tryptone soya broth (TSB), and 1 mL of stock ampicillin/streptomycin. The broth was incubated overnight at 37 ◦C. Subsequently, 10 μL of the enriched broth was spotted onto a premade spot plate coated with log phase E. coli* Famp. The plate was observed after overnight incubation at 37 ◦C for a circular zone of lysis attributed to male-specific coliphages.\\n\\nAPC and coliform counting were performed using Petrifilm aerobic count plates and coliform count plates (3M, SD, USA), respectively [43, 44]. Briefly, 1% peptone water was prepared in advance for dilution of water samples. Once the water sample arrived in the lab, 1 mL of each of the raw and diluted water samples was inoculated on the plate. Subsequently, the inoculated plates were incubated overnight at 37 ◦C. Thereafter, the colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation. On Petrifilm plates, red colonies with gas bubbles were counted as coliforms and blue colonies with gas bubbles as *E. coli*.\\n\\n# 2.5. Weather and Environmental Data\\n\\nThe geographic information for each reservoir was obtained from the Korea rural community corporation [2]. Details regarding catchment area, pondage, and numbers of bungalow fishing spots, fishing sites, and animal farms near the reservoirs are summarized in Table 2. Data for daily average temperature, humidity, and precipitation were collected from the Korea meteorological agency [5]. Subsequently, the relationship between the accumulative precipitation and contamination by foodborne viruses and indicators microorganisms was determined [45, 46]. In this regard, 3-day, 7-day, 10-day, and 14-day accumulative precipitation values were calculated retrogradely from the daily precipitation data.\\n\\n# 2.6. Statistical Analyses\\n\\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient was estimated for analyzing the relationship between viruses and male-specific coliphages. Student’s T-test was performed for analyzing differences in the viral concentrations of the river and reservoir samples and the detection rates in the different precipitation levels. The correlation between weather/environmental factors and prevalence of viruses was analyzed through linear regression analysis (Y = β0 + β1X, where Y is the value of the dependent variable; β0 and β1 are the regression coefficients; and X is a known constant of independent variables). Subsequently, the data were log transformed. The analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics (version 25.0) and statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Microorganisms 2020, 8, 1224\\n\\n# Table 2.

Results\\n\\n# 3.1. Detection of Viruses and Indicator Microorganisms\\n\\nThe prevalence of viruses and indicator microorganisms in the reservoir and river samples is summarized in Table 3. Twenty-nine (30.2%) and 23 (23.9%) of the 96 irrigation water samples tested positive for viruses and male-specific coliphages, respectively. Among the six viruses, HuNoV GII indicated the highest detection rate (27.1%). The detection rates for AdenoV, RotaV, HuNoV GI, and AstroV were 10.4, 10.4, 4.2, and 3.1%, respectively. HAV was not detected in any sample.\\n\\nThe average populations of APC and coliforms in the reservoir samples ranged from 2.07 ± 0.82 to 3.33 ± 0.50 log CFU/mL and 1.15 ± 0.75 to 1.95 ± 0.80 log CFU/mL, respectively. E. coli was detected in four reservoir samples. The contamination of reservoir samples by E. coli was low (1~10 CFU/mL). The average populations of APC and coliforms in the river samples were 3.28 ± 0.29 and 2.10 ± 0.60 log CFU/mL, respectively. E. coli was detected in five of the six water samples (site K) and indicated a population of 7.2 ± 7.98 CFU/mL.\\n\\nGeographically, site H was the most contaminated. The detection rate of virus-positive water samples for sites E, F, G, I, and J were 33.3%. The water sample was twice positive for virus in sites A and C, and only once positive in site D. No viruses nor male-specific coliphages were detected in site B. The Anseong river (site K) was consistently positive for virus and male-specific coliphages except one time.\\n\\nIn this study, the viral recovery efficiency of spiked MNV-1 showed 36.86% ± 27.96% (mean ± SD). This is regarded as the recovery efficiency of viruses. The detected viral loads range from −1.48 to 1.55 log10 genome copies/L. The average viral loads of HuNoV GI, HuNoV GII, AstroV, AdenoV, and RotaV in the reservoir samples were 0.70, −0.08, −0.23, −0.92, and 0.11 log10 genome copies/L, respectively, while those in the river samples were 0.74, 0.63, 0.08, 0.04, and 0.34 log10 genome copies/L, respectively. The reservoir and river samples indicated significantly different viral loads of HuNoV GII and AdenoV (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in the viral loads of HuNoV GI, AstroV, and RotaV between the reservoir and river samples.\\n---\\n# Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses and Indicator Microorganisms\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses and Indicator Microorganisms'),\n",

The seasonal detection rates of viruses in the 76 virus- or coliphage-positive samples were 40.78% and 39.47% during spring and autumn, respectively. The detection rate during summer was low at 19.74%.\\n\\nFigure 3.

AdenoV was detected twice during autumn and four times each during spring and summer. RotaV was frequently detected during autumn (60%, 6/10) in contrast to spring or summer. Astrovirus did not indicate a specific seasonal pattern and was intermittently detected (1–2 times) during each season. Furthermore, 3, 9, and 11 samples collected in summer, spring, and autumn, respectively, were tested positive for coliphages.\\n\\n# 3.3 Correlation between Detected Viruses and Weather Factors\\n\\nTable 5 summarizes the correlations between detected viruses and weather factors. The results indicate that precipitation was significantly correlated with the prevalence of foodborne viruses, male-specific coliphages, HuNoV GII, and AdenoV (p < 0.05). However, humidity and temperature were not correlated with the prevalence of foodborne viruses and male-specific coliphages (p > 0.05).\\n\\nSubsequently, the relationship between contamination by foodborne viruses and accumulative precipitation was analyzed. The results indicate that the 10-day accumulative precipitation was closely related to virus detection in contrast to 7-day and 14-day accumulative precipitation values. The detection rates of foodborne viruses for 10-day accumulative precipitation values ranging from 20–60, <20, and >60 mm were 71.7% (38/53), 20.75% (11/53), and 7.54% (4/53), respectively. Corresponding to the detection rates, 10-day accumulative precipitation values greater than 60 mm indicated significantly lower viral loads in contrast to those less than 60 mm (p < 0.01).\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Microorganisms 2020\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Results of Linear Regression Analysis\\n\\nThis table presents the results of the linear regression analysis between the number of positive samples for viruses/male-specific coliphages and various weather/environmental factors.\\n\\n|Weather/Environmental Factors|Log10β (SE b)|HuNoV GII|AdenoV|RotaV|AstroV|HuNoV GI|HAV| |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Precipitation|0.714 (0.095) *|0.713 (0.030) *|0.706 (0.012) *|0.642 (0.053) *|0.511 (0.067)|0.237 (0.044)|ND| |\\n|Humidity|0.366 (1.279)|0.413 (0.388)|0.428 (0.148)|0.335 (0.651)|0.072 (0.776)|−0.003 (0.449)|ND| |\\n|Temperature|−0.025 (0.315)|−0.002 (0.098)|0.006 (0.038)|0.412 (0.144)|−0.409 (0.163)|0.248 (0.100)|−0.042 (0.113)|ND|\\n|Catchment area|0.233 (0.139)|0.263 (0.143)|0.296 (0.092)|−0.130 (0.094)|0.281 (0.110)|−0.009 (0.049)|−0.110 (0.065)|ND|\\n|Pondage|0.432 (0.076)|0.385 (0.081)|0.489 (0.050)|0.107 (0.055)|0.296 (0.065)|0.130 (0.028)|−0.090 (0.038)|ND|\\n|Livestock|0.267 (0.140)|0.027 (0.145)|0.356 (0.092)|−0.180 (0.095)|0.281 (0.112)|−0.157 (0.049)|−0.065 (0.066)|ND|\\n|Bungalow fishing spot|0.530 (0.117)|0.737 (0.097) *|0.307 (0.080)|0.002 (0.091)|0.663 (0.083)|0.207 (0.046)|−0.016 (0.630)|ND|\\n|Fishing site|0.605 (0.451)|0.480 (0.518)|0.745 (0.255) *|−0.159 (0.371)|0.535 (0.384)|−0.055 (0.193)|−0.083 (0.257)|ND|\\n\\na β: Mean value of the regression coefficient; SE b: Standard error of the regression coefficient. * p &lt; 0.05. b Ten-day accumulative precipitation values and average values of humidity and temperature were collected during the sampling period. c HAV was not detected.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Foodborne Viruses and Environmental Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Foodborne Viruses and Environmental Factors\\n\\n# 3.4.

Correlation between Detected Viruses and Environmental Factors\\n\\nThe relationships between detected viruses and environmental factors are presented in Table 5. Environmental factors, such as catchment area, pondage, and presence of livestock farms were not significantly related to the detection of viruses and male-specific coliphages (p > 0.05). The number of fishing sites was significantly correlated with the detection of HuNoV GII in the reservoirs (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of bungalow fishing spots was significantly correlated with the detection of male-specific coliphages (p < 0.05). As indicated in Tables 2 and 3, foodborne viruses and male-specific coliphages were frequently detected in samples from sites C, F, H, I, and J. These sites were characterized by the presence of fishing sites and several bungalow fishing spots. Unlike regular fishing sites, bungalow fishing spots provided a unique facility for recreational fishing. Specifically, these spots were equipped with toilets and located above the reservoirs. Site B was a small reservoir without any fishing sites or bungalow fishing spots where foodborne viruses and male-specific coliphages were not detected during the sampling period. Site K (the river) was characterized by the downstream merging of sites C and D. The detection rate for male-specific coliphages and viruses were 21.73% (5/23) and 28.30% (15/53), respectively.\\n\\n# 4. Discussion\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first field study to assess the prevalence of foodborne viruses and indicator microorganisms in reservoirs in Gyeonggi province, South Korea. Moreover, several previous studies have examined the effects of inland runoff and rainfall on the water quality of rivers, lakes, and underground water. However, few studies have focused on the surface waters of reservoirs.\\n\\nSeveral GCMs have predicted that drought hazard in the eastern and central regions of Korea contributed to the lasting severe drought in Gyeonggi province in 2017. Therefore, reservoirs in Gyeonggi province played an important role in supplying irrigation water to crops and fresh produce. In this study, indicative bacteria, coliphages, and enteric viruses were monitored for a period of 18 months because temporally variable weather factors, such as heavy rains, floods, and droughts can alter water quality.\\n\\n# 4.1. Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses and Indicator Microorganisms in Reservoirs\\n\\nHuNoV GII was the most frequently detected virus (27.1%) in the reservoir samples. Shin et al. reported that two (14.3%) of the 14 irrigation water samples tested positive for both HuNoV GI and GII. Furthermore, their results indicated sporadic contamination of lettuce and strawberry by HuNoV or HAV in Korea. Similarly, Cheong et al. detected HuNoV in one of the 29 groundwater samples collected from Gyeonggi province. Previous studies have reported significant spatial variation in the detection rates of foodborne viruses in irrigation water. European countries, including Finland, the Czech Republic, Serbia, Poland, Italy, and Germany, have indicated low detection rates of foodborne viruses.\\n\\nFigure 4.

Introduction\\n\\nMicrobial contamination of irrigation water poses significant risks to food safety. This study aims to assess the viral contamination levels in irrigation water sources and their implications for public health.\\n\\n# 2. Results and Discussion\\n\\n# 2.1 Detection Rates of Viruses\\n\\nHuNoV was detected at rates of 3.6% to 8.3% in certain regions, while higher rates (31% to 80%) were reported in Argentina, Ghana, and Egypt. This indicates a need for monitoring viral contamination in irrigation water sources.\\n\\n# 2.2 Adenovirus as an Indicator\\n\\nAdenoV has been identified as a promising viral indicator of surface water quality. Detection frequencies of AdenoV were higher than those of HuNoV in various aquatic environments.\\n\\n# 2.3 Seasonal Variations\\n\\nThe detection rates of foodborne viruses were notably higher in spring and autumn, coinciding with increased irrigation needs during these seasons. HuNoV GII was frequently detected during these periods, highlighting the risk of contamination in fresh produce.\\n\\n# 3. Conclusion\\n\\nMonitoring and controlling viral contamination in irrigation water is crucial for ensuring food safety. Future studies should focus on advanced methods for identifying and tracking viral contaminants.\\n\\n# 4. Recommendations\\n\\nIt is recommended that further research be conducted to assess the viral loads in different water sources and to develop effective strategies for preventing contamination during critical agricultural periods.\\n\\n# 5.

Effects of Weather Factors on the Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses in Reservoirs\\n\\nThe results of this study indicate that rainfall was significantly correlated with the prevalence of foodborne viruses (HuNoV GII and AdenoV) and male-specific coliphages in the reservoirs (Table 5). Previous studies have also identified rainfall as a critical factor affecting the concentrations of pathogenic microorganisms in irrigation water and seawater. In particular, rainfall can alter the concentrations of indicative microorganisms in surface waters through runoff and resuspension of bottom sediments. As indicated in a previous study, heavy rainfall increased E. coli contamination levels in California. Similarly, 70 mm of rainfall decreased E. coli concentrations (<100 CFU/100 mL) in Arizona while no precipitation increased E. coli concentrations (400 CFU/100 mL) in the Rio Grande water. The effect of rainfall on microbial contamination of surface waters has been shown to vary by region, the number of consecutive rainfall events, and flush levels.\\n\\nIn this study, the water samples in reservoirs indicated a high detection frequency of foodborne viruses (71.69%, 38/53) for accumulative precipitation levels ranging from 20 to 60 mm. On the contrary, detection rates and viral loads were low for accumulative precipitation >60 mm. Therefore, moderate-level rainfall events likely increased runoff and resuspension of sediments, thus resulting in the viral contamination of reservoirs. Korea experiences monsoon rains from June to July and intermittent typhoon rains in August. Consecutive moderate-level rainfall events during monsoons may increase the viral contamination of irrigation waters. Contrarily, heavy rains (>60 mm) during typhoons may decrease the contamination of irrigation waters.\\n\\nFurthermore, as indicated in Figure 2, the viral loads of HuNoV GII and AdenoV were significantly higher in the river samples than in the reservoir samples. However, the average viral loads of HuNoV GI, AstroV, and RotaV were not significantly different between the river and reservoir samples. As the correlation analysis presented that the prevalence of HuNoV GII and AdenoV were significantly affected by the rainfall, we concluded that HuNoV and AdenoV from the sediment in the river were easy to be resuspended because of the rainfall. A previous report indicated that the lack of rainfall or droughts can concentrate surface waters and increase microbial concentration levels. The Anseong city experienced a severe drought from May to July 2017. Consequently, the level of irrigation water in the reservoirs was extremely low. Subsequently, algal blooms were observed which further deteriorated the water quality. Moreover, the irrigation water was highly concentrated, and viruses were not detected until the commencement of rainfall in August 2017. Therefore, the concentration of irrigation water during the drought was likely unrelated to virus detection in the reservoirs in this study.\\n\\nDepending on the conditions, foodborne viruses can survive in different environments for several months. Several weather factors, including rainfall, drought, humidity, temperature, and sunlight, affect the microbial infectivity. Especially, low temperature, 10–66% relative humidity, and rainfall are closely associated with HuNoV outbreaks. As Korean spring and autumn has a low temperature, low relative humidity, and moderate rainfall, such an environmental factor may explain that HuNoV was frequently detected in these seasons rather than in summer.\\n\\n# 4.4. Effects of Environmental Factors on the Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses in Reservoirs\\n\\nThis study analyzed the effects of environmental factors (i.e., catchment area, pondage, and numbers of livestock farms, bungalow fishing spots, and fishing sites near the reservoirs) on the prevalence of viruses and indicator microorganisms in the reservoirs. Previous studies have indicated...\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3, h4 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.author-contributions, .funding, .conflicts-of-interest {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# 5. Conclusions\\n\\nThis study indicated that the environmental and weather factors were closely associated with the prevalence of foodborne viruses in reservoirs in South Korea. Especially, precipitation was highly correlated with the virus detection and male-specific coliphages. Furthermore, fishing sites and recreational facilities were identified as important sources of viral contamination in the reservoirs. As reservoirs play an important role in providing irrigation water, the microbiological monitoring and elimination of a contamination source will be needed to control the risk of viral contamination.\\n\\n# Supplementary Materials\\n\\nSupplementary Materials can be found at http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/8/1224/s1.\\n\\nFigure S1: Pearson correlation analysis for foodborne viruses and male-specific coliphages.\\n\\n# Author Contributions\\n\\nZ.W. performed sample collecting and experimentalizing, and prepared the manuscript, tables, and figures; H.S. performed sampling and experimentalizing; S.J. performed sampling and experimentalizing; D.Y. and H.P. performed table and figure correcting; S.S. generated the statistical analysis correcting; D.J.S. generated sampling and experimentalizing; K.H.P. generated experimental design; C.C. conceptualized this work and edited the manuscript.

Introduction\\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has suggested that aside from other climatic alterations, including temperature elevation, there are more land surfaces where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). There has been substantial evidence on the linkage between climate change and both extreme precipitation (O'Gorman, 2015) and drought (Mann & Gleick, 2015), and therefore, the potential impact on both the abundance and quality of ground water has been indicated (Taylor et al., 2013).\\n\\nDiarrhea is one of the top three leading causes of children's mortality globally (GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators, 2015; Lozano et al., 2012). In Hong Kong, rotavirus has been the most common pathogen causing diarrhea among children under 5 (Biswas et al., 1996). Evidence has shown that rotavirus and norovirus were the most common viruses introducing diarrheal hospitalizations among children under 18, of which 87% were children aged 0–5 years (Li et al., 2009). In an investigation of epidemics of acute viral gastroenteritis from 2001 to 2005 in Hong Kong, of all gastroenteritis patients, norovirus-positive cases accounted for 25%, among which 40% were under-five children (Ho et al., 2006). However, the noro-positive rate had decreased to 9.9% in 2013, 10.7% in 2014, and 10.8% in 2015, according to the Centre for Health Protection (Centre for Health Protection, 2016).\\n\\nDiarrheal diseases can be attributable to various environmental factors (Chou et al., 2010; Hashizume et al., 2007; Phung et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014). Of all the existing evidence, two meta-analyses, one covering the tropics and the other focused on Southeast Asia, examined the seasonality of rotavirus infection and concluded that 1 cm increase in mean monthly rainfall was associated with 1% and 0.3% reduction in the incidence, respectively (Jagai et al., 2012; Levy et al., 2009). Several observational studies, from the United Arab Emirates (Ijaz et al., 1994a), India (Sumi et al., 2013), Venezuela (Gonzalez Chavez, 2015) and Hong Kong (Mitui et al., 2011), found that more rotavirus cases occurred during seasons in which there was less rainfall; however, these studies did not assess associations with rainfall independent of seasonality and other meteorological variables. Two studies employing time-series regression, one from Spain (Hervas et al., 2014) and one from Great Britain and The Netherlands (Atchison et al., 2010), found no evidence of an independent association between rain and rotavirus disease. More consistent results have been reported for norovirus infection. A systematic review of the global seasonality of norovirus (Ahmed et al., 2013) reported a positive association between norovirus outbreaks and average rainfall in the wettest months. And both higher incidence of norovirus outbreaks and higher loads of microbial in beach waters have been observed with heavy antecedent rainfall in studies from Australia (Bruggink & Marshall, 2010), Norway (Eregno et al., 2016) and Louisiana, USA (Wang & Deng, 2016). Nonetheless, except for the study in Australia reporting a 90-day lag between peak average rainfall and norovirus epidemic (Bruggink & Marshall, 2010), the delayed effect of precipitation on both rotavirus and norovirus remains unclear. Other meteorological factors investigated previously include temperature and relative humidity (RH). Generally, cool and dry weather conditions were associated with higher rotavirus incidence while the association between temperature and norovirus infection remains inconclusive. Studies from England and Wales (Lopman et al., 2009) and Toronto, Canada (Greer et al., 2009) found every 1 °C increase in air temperature was statistically significantly associated with a 15% reduction and an 8% increase in the risk of norovirus infection, respectively.\\n\\nThe present study aimed to explore possible associations of rainfall as well as ambient temperature and RH with both rotavirus and norovirus infection and their lag dependencies in a subtropical Chinese city, Hong Kong.\\n\\n# Table 1: Descriptive Summary for Children Hospitalizations of Rotavirus and Norovirus Infection and Daily Total Rainfall in Hong Kong\"),\n",

Methods\\n\\n# 2.1. Data Sources\\n\\nA large database of admissions from all Hong Kong public hospitals, capturing approximately 83% of all admissions in the region, was obtained from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. Daily counts of hospitalizations due to rotavirus and norovirus infection from 2002 through 2011, with discharge diagnoses encoded with the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9, code for rotavirus/norovirus: 008.61/008.63) were extracted. Hospitalized patients whose age was younger than 5 years old were included in the analysis. Daily total rainfall as well as daily average values of other meteorological variables during the same study period, including daily mean temperature, mean relative humidity (RH), mean wind speed, and global solar radiation, were retrieved from the Hong Kong Observatory.\\n\\nPartial autocorrelation plots were used to determine the order of autoregressive terms in the models. Penalized spline function with certain degrees of freedom (df) was applied to day of the year and day of the study period to adjust for inter-annual seasonal variation and long-term trend for both types of infections, respectively. The models were formulated as follows:\\n\\nlog E(Yt) = β0 + X cb(meteorological variables; df1) + (lag; df2) + s(DOY; df3) + s(t; df4) + factor(DOW) + factor(holiday) + autoregressive terms\\n\\n# 2.2. Statistical Analysis\\n\\nDot plots during the entire study period were used for the visual check of time trend of both types of infections as well as their relationship with daily total rainfall, mean temperature, and relative humidity. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) with negative binomial distribution assumed to account for possible over-dispersion were constructed for the assessment of exposure-response associations between daily counts of rotavirus and norovirus infection, and daily total rainfall (natural logarithm-transformed) and other meteorological factors as well as their lag dependencies simultaneously.\\n\\nFig. 1.

Descriptive Statistics\\n\\nThere was a total of 8309 and 3928 cases of rotavirus and norovirus hospitalizations among children under 5 years old from 2002 through 2011 in Hong Kong, respectively. Of all these cases, 7263 (87.4%) and 2233 (56.8%) hospitalizations due to rotavirus and norovirus infection were recorded in winter, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics for daily counts of rotavirus and norovirus admissions and daily total rainfall, mean temperature, and relative humidity (RH) during the entire study period. Time-series of hospitalizations due to these two types of infections as well as meteorological variations are shown in Fig. 1. Rotavirus was consistently commonly circulated in winter when the least rainfall was recorded throughout the year, whereas norovirus hospitalization showed a bi-annual pattern, including a major peak in winter and a minor peak in summer, with one exception in the summer of 2006 when an unusually large epidemic was reported. While hospitalizations for both diseases were more common in the winter, the winter predominance of rotavirus hospitalizations was much stronger than that for norovirus.\\n\\n# 3.2.

Wang et al. / Science of the Total Environment 643 (2018) 414–422\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that the relative risks (RRs) of rotavirus and norovirus hospitalizations were significantly influenced by environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity (RH). Specifically, at cumulative lags of 0–10 and 0–7 days, the RRs were 47.3% (95% CI 0.29–0.78) at 30 °C (97th percentile, relative to 17 °C). The exposure-response association for norovirus was notably stronger in summer, with 34.1 mm of rainfall correlating to a 2.95 times increased risk of hospitalization, compared to 1.66 times in winter.\\n\\nFurthermore, the lag-response association was not significantly affected by seasonal modifications. Higher temperatures above 17 °C were linked to fewer hospitalizations for both infections. In contrast, higher RH levels (50–80% and 60–85%) were associated with fewer rotavirus but more norovirus hospitalizations.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThis study investigated the associations between hospitalizations for rotavirus and norovirus and environmental factors in Hong Kong. The findings indicated that greater rainfall was associated with fewer rotavirus hospitalizations but more norovirus hospitalizations.

Previous studies have shown that the risk of infection decreases with rising temperatures. Laboratory evidence indicates that the viability and infectivity of both viruses diminish rapidly with increased temperature, suggesting that lower temperatures may facilitate fecal-oral transmission due to longer persistence on contaminated surfaces.\\n\\nIn contrast, relative humidity (RH) exhibited an opposite association with the two infections. A steep drop in rotavirus infections was observed at RH levels between 50% and 80%, while norovirus infections increased at RH levels between 60% and 88%. This suggests that lower RH may enhance rotavirus survival and transmission, while higher RH may facilitate norovirus transmission.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nThis study provides evidence on the association of rainfall, temperature, and humidity with infectious diarrheal diseases in a subtropical setting. Heavy precipitation correlates with increased pediatric norovirus hospitalizations but decreased rotavirus hospitalizations. Higher temperatures are associated with fewer hospitalizations for both diseases, while higher relative humidity is linked to more norovirus but fewer rotavirus hospitalizations.\\n\\n# Data Availability\\n\\nThe authors cannot make the minimal data set publicly available due to agreements with the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.

In conjunction with predicted increases in temperature, proliferation in the survival of microorganisms in hotter environments is expected. This is likely to lead, in turn, to an increase in contamination of food and water and a rise in numbers of cases of infectious gastroenteritis. This study assessed the relationship of Campylobacter spp. with temperature and heatwaves, in Adelaide, South Australia.\\n\\nWe estimated the effect of (i) maximum temperature and (ii) heatwaves on daily Campylobacter cases during the warm seasons (1 October to 31 March) from 1990 to 2012 using Poisson regression models.\\n\\nThere was no evidence of a substantive effect of maximum temperature per 1 °C rise (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0·995, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0·993–0·997) nor heatwaves (IRR 0·906, 95% CI 0·800–1·026) on Campylobacter cases. In relation to heatwave intensity, which is the daily maximum temperature during a heatwave, notifications decreased by 19% within a temperature range of 39–40·9 °C (IRR 0·811, 95% CI 0·692–0·952). We found little evidence of an increase in risk and lack of association between Campylobacter cases and temperature or heatwaves in the warm seasons. Heatwave intensity may play a role in that notifications decreased with higher temperatures. Further examination of the role of behavioural and environmental factors in an effort to reduce the risk of increased Campylobacter cases is warranted.\\n\\nKey words: Campylobacter, climate, impact of food-borne infections, infectious disease epidemiology.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nChanges in climatic conditions, such as warmer ambient temperature and increased frequency in heatwaves, are considered to be contributing factors to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. Infectious gastrointestinal diseases, including those that are food-borne, are influenced by weather conditions, and this has been evident with increased cases and outbreaks of salmonellosis linked to elevated ambient temperature.

Milazzo and others have noted that the relationship between temperature, climate variability, and the incidence of Campylobacter infections is not entirely clear. Some studies indicate a positive association between increasing temperatures and the incidence of cases [6–13], while others report an inverse or no relationship [14–16]. Most of these studies have been conducted in Europe, particularly in England and Wales [8–11, 13, 15], as well as in the USA and Canada [6, 7, 12]. Only two studies have focused on Australasia: one was a multi-city study [15], and the other compared Adelaide (the capital city of South Australia) and Brisbane (the capital city of Queensland) [14].\\n\\nHuman infection with Campylobacter spp. is a significant cause of food-borne illness, leading to considerable morbidity in both individuals and populations [17]. In 2010, out of 550 million reported cases of infectious gastroenteritis worldwide, 96 million were attributed to Campylobacter spp., making it the most common bacterial infectious agent [17]. In Australia, it is estimated that 4.7% of the 16.6 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are caused by Campylobacter spp. [18]. In South Australia, approximately 2000 Campylobacter notifications occur each year. Heatwaves, characterized by prolonged and elevated temperatures, may accelerate the development of the pathogen, affect its reservoirs, and influence human behavior regarding food storage and transportation. Given the predicted rise in temperature and frequency of heatwaves, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of these climatic variables on Campylobacter notifications.\\n\\n# Aim of the Study\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to assess the relationship between reported cases of Campylobacter spp. and temperature and heatwaves. The findings will inform the design of public health messages and interventions aimed at improving food safety, prevention, and control to reduce the burden associated with warmer ambient temperatures due to climate change.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nAdelaide experiences a Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers, with increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves [19]. The average ambient temperature in South Australia has risen by 0.96 °C over the past 95 years, a rate that is more rapid than the national average [20].\\n\\n# Data Collection\\n\\n# Notifiable Cases\\n\\nLaboratory-confirmed Campylobacter cases reported to the Communicable Disease Control Branch (CDCB), South Australia Department for Health and Ageing, between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2012, were obtained from their notifiable disease surveillance system. Cases were included if the individual was a resident of metropolitan Adelaide. Demographic characteristics and illness information were extracted for each case.\\n\\n# Temperature Data\\n\\nDaily maximum temperature (Tmax) recordings in degrees Celsius (°C) from 1990 to 2012 were obtained from an Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) weather monitoring station near the Adelaide city center. Tmax was chosen as the exposure variable as it is considered a better index of exposure than average or minimum temperature [3, 21]. This aligns with previous studies in Adelaide where Tmax was used as a predictor of health outcomes related to heat exposure [22, 23].\\n\\n# Heatwave Definition\\n\\nIn this study, a heatwave was defined as occurring when the daily Tmax reached or exceeded 35 °C for three or more consecutive days. This definition has been utilized in previous heat-health studies conducted in Adelaide [4, 22–25]. Due to uncertainties regarding the characteristics that make heatwaves hazardous to health [26], we assessed the role of intensity (Tmax of ≥35 °C during a heatwave event), duration (length of a heatwave in days), and timing (occurrence of a heatwave within the season) on daily Campylobacter notifications.\\n\\n# Analysis\\n\\n# Temperature Effects\\n\\nA time-series Poisson regression model was employed to estimate the effect of Tmax on daily Campylobacter cases. The analysis dataset was restricted to the warm season from October 1 to March 31 to control for potential confounding effects of seasonal fluctuations [27].\\n\\nSpearman’s correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between Tmax and the daily number of Campylobacter notifications during the warm season.

We controlled for autocorrelation (AC) of daily Campylobacter notifications based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial ACF so as to identify the most appropriate autoregressive (AR) order.\\n\\nTo take into account potential confounders of temperature effects, we included day of the week (as a categorical variable with Sunday as the reference day), public holidays (as an indicator variable), and linear and quadratic terms for year to adjust for long-term trends. Lag values were also included to estimate the delayed effects of temperature on daily Campylobacter notifications. In the case of overdispersion, a negative binomial model was fitted. Goodness-of-fit tests were used to assess model fit.\\n\\nDifferent temperature thresholds were examined to ascertain if a differential relationship across the temperature spectrum existed for a number of Campylobacter cases. A lowess smoother at a bandwidth of 0.8 was used to assess the shape of the exposure–response relationship between Tmax and counts of Campylobacter. Piecewise linear regression models were fitted with a single breakpoint at the identified temperature thresholds using the ‘hockey-stick’ nl command in Stata.\\n\\n# Heatwave Effects\\n\\nPoisson regression models were used to examine the effect of heatwaves on daily Campylobacter cases. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for the clustering of observations within a heatwave. We accepted an exchangeable correlation structure within each cluster of heatwave days and used the quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion to select the best working correlation structure. Similar to the models we used to assess the effect of Tmax on daily Campylobacter notifications, we included day of the week, public holidays, and year and year² in our statistical models.\\n\\n# Heatwave Characteristics\\n\\nAs well as examining each of the three heatwave characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing, as described earlier), we also estimated the overall effects of heatwaves on daily notifications by including a binary variable (heatwave and non-heatwave days). Separate models were fitted to examine the effects of each heatwave characteristic on the number of daily Campylobacter cases. Heatwave day (e.g., days 3, 4, or 5) was used to examine the day which produced a greater risk of Campylobacter infection. Intensity was defined as daily Tmax recorded within heatwaves with four temperature ranges (35–36.9, 37–38.9, 39–40.9, and 541 °C) included in the model. We examined duration by length of 3, 4, and 5 or more days. We also considered whether the duration was short (3 days) compared with long (4 or more days). We considered two different characteristics of timing. We defined timing by the first, second, and third heatwave events within each warm season denoting the order of occurrence. We then examined whether timing differed by the occurrence of a heatwave event in the early part of the warm season (October to December) or later (January to March).\\n\\nWe report incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with results interpreted as percent (%) change in the number of daily Campylobacter counts per °C increase in Tmax and during heatwave periods compared with non-heatwave periods. A significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. Analyses were conducted using StataSE 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA).\\n\\n# Ethics Approval\\n\\nEthics approval was given by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Adelaide (H-202–2011) and the SA Department for Health and Ageing (463/07/2014).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Descriptive Statistics\\n\\nIn Adelaide, from 1990 to 2012, 35,601 Campylobacter cases were notified, with 18,570 (52%) reporting onset of illness in the warm season. During this period, there were no outbreaks detected, and hence no records were excluded from the analyses. Figure 1 shows the temporal distribution of daily Campylobacter spp. notifications over the entire study period with no obvious peaks occurring in the warmer months.\\n\\nTemperature summary statistics for the entire study period, by season, and by heatwaves are displayed in Table 1. The mean daily Tmax during the warm seasons was 26.5 °C (standard deviation (S.D.) = 6.1) and 38.4 °C (S.D. = 2.2) during heatwaves. Over the study period, 213 heatwave days across 50 distinct episodes were recorded. The length of heatwaves ranged from 3 to 15 days with a mean of 3.17 (S.D. = 2.40).\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Temperature on Campylobacter Infections\\n\\n# Graphs by Year\\n\\nFig. 1.

There was no lagged effect of Tmax on the number of daily Campylobacter cases. A third-order AC of the number of campylobacteriosis notifications was detected (IRR 1.037, 95% CI 1.032–1.042, P < 0.01).

Exposure–response relationship between maximum temperature and daily Campylobacter notifications reported in the warm season (October to March), 1990–2012, Adelaide, South Australia.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nOur study found that there is no substantive effect of Tmax on daily Campylobacter cases in the warm seasons. When examining the effect of heatwaves on daily Campylobacter notifications, there was little evidence of an increased risk of infection. These findings indicate that Campylobacter incidence in Adelaide may not be affected by temperature in the warm seasons or during heatwaves.\\n\\nFew studies have examined the relationship between temperature and Campylobacter spp. in the warm seasons, and none so far have considered the effects of heatwaves on cases. Among those studies that have been conducted, a positive association of increasing temperature and incidence of cases has been reported in studies from Europe, the UK, the USA, and Canada.\\n\\nOur findings that temperature and heatwaves did not increase the risk of infection concur with a study in Adelaide that has a temperate climate, contrasting with Brisbane's sub-tropical climate. The study in Adelaide found an inverse relationship with temperature and Campylobacter cases, yet in Brisbane, the effect was positive. It is postulated that this difference could be associated with weather conditions specific to that area, which could have an impact on animal reservoirs or processes along the food chain.\\n\\nLikewise, a multi-jurisdictional study that compared the effects of temperature on Campylobacter infection across multiple continents did not find a strong effect of temperature on Campylobacter cases. This suggests that the impact of temperature on cases varies within and between geographical regions, thereby affecting disease transmission and environmental routes.\\n\\nWe found no lagged effect of temperature in the warm seasons on cases. Contrary to this, previous studies found lags ranged from 1 to 6 weeks. A positive association was found between Campylobacter and temperature in the current and previous weeks in a UK study. Studies that identified long lags of 8 weeks or more were those that had a null effect of temperature on Campylobacter cases. The lack of a lag effect in our study suggests that the main route of transmission may not be significantly influenced by temperature variations.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Effect of Heatwave Characteristics on Daily Campylobacter Cases\\n\\n# Table 2: Effect Estimates\\n\\n|Heatwave Characteristic|IRR|(95% CI)|P-value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Heatwave|0.906|0.800–1.026|0.126|\\n|Day of heatwave| | | |\\n|Day 3|0.916|0.805–1.042|0.184|\\n|Day 4|0.882|0.723–1.077|0.221|\\n|Day 5|0.850|0.656–1.101|0.219|\\n|Duration| | | |\\n|Short|0.916|0.805–1.042|0.184|\\n|Long|0.873|0.724–1.053|0.157|\\n|Duration by length| | | |\\n|Day 3|0.795|0.689–0.918|0.002|\\n|Day 4|1.113|0.917–1.351|0.278|\\n|Day 5|0.842|0.641–1.108|0.221|\\n|Timing by order of occurrence in a season| | | |\\n|First heatwave|0.818|0.679–0.987|0.036|\\n|Second heatwave|0.884|0.731–1.069|0.207|\\n|Third heatwave|1.019|0.811–1.280|0.871|\\n|Timing by months in season| | | |\\n|Early|1.145|1.099–1.192|&lt;0.001|\\n|Late (referent)|1| | |\\n|Intensity by temperature range| | | |\\n|35–36.9 °C|0.938|0.803–1.095|0.421|\\n|37–38.9 °C|0.919|0.804–1.052|0.223|\\n|39–40.9 °C|0.811|0.692–0.952|0.010|\\n|541 °C|0.949|0.745–1.209|0.676|\"),\n",

Generally, lag effects indicate when and where food contamination could have occurred, with short time lags pointing to food contamination closer to the time of consumption, and long lags indicating effects at the production processing stages. In our study, we found that the number of campylobacteriosis notifications was related to the number occurring in the previous 3 days. As there was little evidence in our study of a lagged effect of temperature on daily counts, we did not further explore this association with heatwaves.\\n\\nWe were unable to discern a temperature threshold, although by visually inspecting the plot, we observed a decrease in cases with a rise in Tmax above approximately 36 °C. These results need to be interpreted with caution and warrant further investigation. It may be that ambient temperature in the warm seasons and heatwaves are not linked to an increase in the risk of infection as indicated by daily Campylobacter notifications as the bacteria is sensitive to high temperature. The relationship between pathogen growth and temperature is non-linear, and there could be a temperature above which proliferation and survival of Campylobacter spp. in the environment will begin to decline. Campylobacter spp. does not multiply at temperatures below 30 °C; hence, the bacteria do not increase in foods kept at usual room temperatures in temperate regions.\\n\\nLimitations in this study are similar to those reported in our related work concerned with effects of temperature and heatwaves on Salmonella cases. Passive disease surveillance systems are likely to result in an under-reporting of Campylobacter notifications, but this is not likely to affect the estimates of the association between temperature and heatwaves in the warm seasons and the risk of Campylobacter infection. We did not exclude cases that travelled prior to becoming unwell because of the incomplete data recorded in the disease notification surveillance system. Only a small proportion of cases are expected to travel, and inclusion of cases that travelled is unlikely to affect the results.\\n\\nIt remains unclear as to why Campylobacter infections have a less obvious relationship than Salmonella with temperature and heatwaves.\\n---\\n# Effects of Temperature and Heatwaves on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Temperature and Heatwaves on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nTemperature and climate variability significantly influence the transmission of campylobacteriosis, which is complex due to various routes and exposure pathways, including environmental paths [33, 34]. The seasonality of campylobacteriosis, peaking in spring, is not fully understood, but environmental factors are believed to play a role [30].\\n\\nCampylobacter spp. is ubiquitous in the environment, with hosts including wild and domestic animals and birds. It can be found in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, rabbits, cats, chickens, turkeys, ducks, and pigs [35]. It is hypothesized that flies may act as vectors for the transmission of Campylobacter spp. to humans [36]. Food-borne transmission is another significant route, with poultry meat being the primary source of Campylobacter infection in humans [37]. A case-control study in Australia identified chicken consumption as the main risk factor for Campylobacter infection, estimating over 50,000 cases each year [38]. Although Campylobacter spp. is sensitive to high temperatures and dry environments, the bacteria survive well in poultry processing stages, further supporting poultry meat as a high-risk food for Campylobacter transmission to humans.\\n\\nEnvironmental transmission of Campylobacter infection via birds, farm, and other wild animals to humans is multifactorial. The various routes of transmission, some of which may not be temperature-dependent, are complex. Our study, along with previous research, indicates that varying environmental and climatic conditions across continents, countries, and regions may impact disease transmission and case incidence [14]. This highlights the need for further studies in different countries with diverse climatic conditions to better understand the role of temperature in the incidence of Campylobacter infection.\\n\\nOur study suggests that temperature has a limited role in the increased incidence of Campylobacter notifications during the warm season, and we found little evidence for an effect of heatwaves on cases. The limited understanding of the reservoirs and transmission routes for Campylobacter infection complicates the determination of the role of ambient temperature in the warm season on disease incidence. Nevertheless, previous studies have established a relationship between temperature and the environment, particularly as emerging evidence of climate change predicts an increase in the frequency of warmer days.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors thank staff from the Disease Surveillance and Investigation Section, Communicable Disease Control Branch, Department for Health and Ageing (SA Health) for their support in conducting this study.\\n\\n# Declaration of Interest\\n\\nWe confirm that there is no conflict of interest.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

Climate and weather factors are known to affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases and statistical and mathematical modelling are continuously developing to investigate the impact of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. There have been little critical analyses of the methodological approaches. Our objective is to review and summarize statistical and modelling methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, in order to identify limitations and knowledge gaps in developing of new methods. We conducted a systematic review of English-language papers published from 2000 to 2015. Search terms included concepts related to water-associated diseases, weather and climate, statistical, epidemiological and modelling methods. We found 102 full text papers that met our criteria and were included in the analysis. The most commonly used methods were grouped in two clusters: process-based models (PBM) and time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE). In general, PBM methods were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of the pathogen under study was relatively well known (e.g. Vibrio cholerae); TS-SE tended to be used when the specific environmental mechanisms were unclear (e.g. Campylobacter). Important data and methodological challenges emerged, with implications for surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The most common limitations comprised: non-inclusion of key factors (e.g. biological mechanism, demographic heterogeneity, human behavior), reporting bias, poor data quality, and collinearity in exposures. Furthermore, the methods often did not distinguish among the multiple sources of time-lags (e.g. patient physiology, reporting bias, healthcare access) between environmental drivers and health outcomes.\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n#\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nLondon, and the Met Office; and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for the MEDMI Project.

Climate and weather affect the transmission and distribution of infectious diseases. Therefore, scientists are continuously developing new analysis methods to investigate the impacts of weather and climate on infectious disease, and particularly, on those associated with water. As these methods are based on an imperfect representation of the real world, they are inevitably subjected to many challenges. Based on a systematic review of the literature, we identified seven important challenges for scientists who develop new analysis methods.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThe seasonal and geographic distributions of infectious diseases are currently among the best indications of an association with weather and climate. The literature on climate effects is expanding in response to concerns about global climate change. The significance of the methods and data available is not only confined to the technical procedural aspects; methods and data also impact on the formulation of the specific scientific questions, their selection, and the development of hypotheses. Although our understanding of how weather and climate affect diseases has improved, the wide range of research methods applied make it difficult to get a robust overview of the state of research.\\n\\nThe relationship between climate/weather and infectious diseases is complex (e.g. [1]), as shown in the example illustrated in Fig 1. Investigating the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases requires the ability to: i) disentangle concurrent modes of transmissions (e.g. environmental from human-to-human transmission); ii) tease apart the individual effects of multiple exposures at different temporal and spatial scales; iii) identify and separate socio-economic drivers and behavioural causes; iv) integrate all these different processes into a unified perspective; v) attribute changes in disease to observed environmental changes (such as climate change); and vi) quantify infectious disease burden resulting from current social, economic and environmental conditions which can help to project the future disease burden resulting from these changes. These are difficult methodological and conceptual demands, and the scientific and public health community could benefit from a critical overview of the available research methods and the challenges ahead.\\n\\nIn this paper, we focus on the particularly important, especially in developing countries, class of infectious diseases associated with water (including those classified as neglected tropical diseases (NTD) according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) [2], the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3], and the journal Plos NTD [4]) (Table 1). According to WHO estimates, 1.1 billion people globally drink water that is of at least ‘moderate’ risk of faecal contamination [5], and 842,000 annual deaths are attributable to unsafe water.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.legend {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n# Temporal Dynamics\\n\\nUnderstanding the temporal dynamics in the pathogen reservoir, modes of exposure, and human host is crucial for addressing water-associated diseases.

The date of reporting varies (e.g., the day of disease onset or when the specimen was sent to the diagnostic laboratory or when the patient visited the general practitioner).\\n\\nFig 1. Illustration of the steps and potential pathways from being exposed to the pathogen reservoir to detection of disease. The red (blue) taps and swimmers represent contaminated (uncontaminated) drinking and recreational water. The red (blue) silhouette represents infected (not-infected) humans. Here and throughout, any kind of environment containing pathogens that can serve as a medium for transmission (e.g., drinking water, sewage system) is referred to as “pathogen reservoir”; any form of direct or indirect contact with such medium, irrespective of the presence of the pathogen, is referred to as an “exposure”. According to this conceptual scheme, a disease-free situation is the combination of negligible pathogen presence.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n#\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nInfections arise from increased interactions of exposed susceptibles with the pathogen reservoir. This can be caused by a growth in the pathogen population (driven, for example, by temperature) and/or larger exposure to the pathogen. An increase in the exposure can be directly or indirectly driven by meteorological/climate variables (e.g. high temperature increasing the risk of drinking contaminated water), environmental causes (e.g. poor water drainage management due to land use), and behavioural and/or socio-economic factors (e.g. recreational activity in unclean water). Changes in the population of susceptibles (for example due to immigration, loss of immunity and/or human-to-human transmission) can alter the patterns of exposure.\\n\\nWater supply, sanitation and hygiene (including 361,000 deaths of children under age five), mostly in lower income countries.\\n\\nInfectious diseases associated with water are classified as follows: “water-system-related” infections (i.e. via aerosols from poorly managed cooling systems, e.g. Legionellosis), “water-based” infections (i.e. via aquatic vectors or intermediate hosts, e.g. Schistosomiasis), “water-borne” infections (i.e. via bacterial, parasitic and viral oral-faecal infection through ingestion, e.g. cholera), and “water-washed” infections (i.e. infections arising from poor hygiene due to insufficient water, these can also include oral-faecal infection, e.g. hookworm). Here and throughout, we use the expression “water-associated” to refer to these latter classes of diseases. Of note, we excluded diseases arising from ingestion/contact with inorganic and other chemical compounds (e.g. arsenic) and vector-borne infections linked with water (e.g. malaria, rift valley fever, river blindness) from the “water-associated” diseases.\\n\\nThis Review is not a prescriptive guideline of available methods for a range of problems. We reviewed and summarised the methods used to investigate the effects of weather and climate on infectious diseases associated with water, with the objective of identifying the challenges that scientists are facing when developing new analysis methods. We focused on quantitative analytical approaches, such as: mathematical models, statistical analysis, computational techniques, numerical simulations, epidemiological models and computer-generated agent-based models. We excluded purely descriptive observational studies.\\n\\nDiscriminating between studies which build explanatory models versus create predictive models is particularly important in statistical modelling. We, however, avoided this way of grouping. The dichotomy explanatory vs predictive models might be clear from an epistemological point of view; nevertheless, we have found it really challenging to rigorously separate papers according to this classification. For most papers, a formal distinction is often impossible as the causal relationships are inferred/discussed from the patterns captured from predictive models, and vice versa the hypothetical-deductive models (e.g. driven by causal relationships), could both be able to predict a range of future scenarios.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Search Strategy, Selection Criteria and Methods\\n\\nThe methods for the systematic review followed the Guidelines developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. We searched for English language articles published from 2000 to April 2015. The following databases were searched: Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Global Health and LILACS bibliographic databases. The literature after April 2015 was also monitored using a daily email alert tool provided by Google Scholar (searching for “water borne disease” and “water related disease”) to identify potential papers adopting newly-developed methods not covered by the initial search.\\n\\nWe used search terms related to water-associated diseases (e.g. “water transmission” OR “contaminated fresh water” OR “unsafe water supply” etc.) and quantitative methodologies (e.g. “mathematical epidemiology” OR “simulation”) and weather and climate.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Water-Associated Diseases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Organisms Causing Diseases Related to Water\\n\\nThe symbol ● specifies the known routes of transmission (not exclusively); (●) specifies the probable route of transmission but no direct evidence available.

Analysis of the findings and synthesis of the challenges in formulating new methods are summarised below.\\n\\n# Analysis: Seven Particular Scientific Questions Addressed by the Review\\n\\n1. # What are the main water-associated pathogens investigated and where do they occur?\\n\\nFig 3 shows the frequency of pathogens in the final set of papers. Vibrio cholerae has been studied most for climate and weather effects. A significant proportion (approximately 20% of papers) focused on unspecified water-associated pathogens and these studies were mostly theoretical process-based models. The next significant categories of studies were papers that looked at diarrheal illness as a broad category based on health service data that did not include pathogen-specific information. In terms of pathogen-specific outcomes, the following pathogens were most studied (after Vibrio cholerae): Cryptosporidium spp., Leptospira spp., Schistosoma spp., Giardia sp., and Salmonella spp.. Many of these are classified as NTD [2–4] e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Leptospira spp., Schistosoma spp., Giardia sp. (Table 1).\\n\\nFig 4 shows the countries where the studies were based. A good proportion of these theoretical process-based models did not link their study with any data for diseases occurring in a particular country (therefore, the outcome was listed as “General” in Fig 4). The country with the most studies (about 10% of papers) was Bangladesh, mostly in relation to cholera, followed by studies on disease data collected in the US, China, and Canada (Fig 4).\\n\\nThus, the pathogens reported in these studies reflect geographic (origin of infections) and socio-economic (quality of data) features: studies on cholera were associated with low and middle-income countries, while Cryptosporidium spp. and Campylobacter spp. were more likely reported in high-income countries that have good laboratory-based passive surveillance systems (Fig 4).\\n2. # What methods have been used?\\n\\nThe set of all technical keywords describing the methods used in at least two papers is displayed in a keyword network in Fig 5 (a high-resolution image for the methods used in each paper can be found in the Supporting Information, S1 Fig, see also S1 Table). The figure suggests that the most commonly used methods can be grouped into two main clusters:\\n\\n- Process-Based Models (PBM), which are typically described by mechanistic compartmental models [14],\\n- Time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE) such as time series and regression analysis [15] and spatial methods typically based on geographic information system (GIS) [16].\\n\\nThese clusters can overlap. For example, instances of spatial compartmental models have been developed.\\n\\nFig 5 is perhaps the most objective way of representing the methods used in the reviewed papers as it is based simply on the technical keywords recorded by their authors. As the technical keywords can be very specific, the next exercise was to identify the general methods used in the papers. A list of the most common general methods is shown in Fig 6 and in S1 Table in the Supporting Information. The entries in Fig 6 and S1 Table do not reflect an established taxonomy of the methods (which is not available in the literature); they are mainly guided by the patterns which emerged from the keyword network (Fig 5) and selected based on their relevance.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n#\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n# Abstracts Overview\\n\\n|Database| | |English|Non-English|Conference|Total|Duplicates|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |Medline|8,062|452|Abstracts|8,514|2,953|\\n| | |Embase|11,468|345|387|13,200|1,877|\\n| | |CINAHL|231| | | | |\\n| | |Global Health|2,657| |249|2,906|591|\\n| | |LILACS| | | | | |\\n| | |SCOPUS| | | | | |\\n| | |Total|22,509|798|536|24,943|5,461|\\n\\nNo Duplicates: 17,048 (English: 17,048, Non-English: 665, Conference: 1,474)\\n\\nExclusions: 7,895 total (5,461 duplicates, 1,636 non-English)\\n\\n# Selection Process\\n\\n17,048 abstracts were stored in EndNote.

Cosinor and spectral analyses may be used, but also simple tabulation of rates by season. However, in this review we did not find this particular type of studies.|Can give strong indirect information on dependence of disease on weather, but may be misleading if any other risk factors also vary seasonally (e.g. holidays).|\\n|Time Series Regression with Auto-Regressive Models (Disease forecasting studies)|These studies, often using Box-Jenkins methods such as (S)ARIMA, and sometimes incorporating preceding weather as predictors, seek a method to obtain a forecast of disease in the short term future given the series up to present.|Those forecasting studies that explicitly incorporate weather variables can indirectly provide information on weather-disease associations, but may not separate components that are causal from those due to co-varying factors (e.g. holidays).|\\n|Time series regression I (studies of short term associations)|These studies seek to directly explore the dependence of disease patterns over time on preceding and concurrent weather. Their methods are based on standard GLMs (or occasionally GAMs), in particular Poisson and negative binomial models. Most studies control bias from temporal trends and seasonal patterns not necessarily due to weather, and other measured time-varying risk factors.|Dependence of disease on weather in the explicit focus of these studies. However, it is unclear how much they could be relied on to predict impact of climate change.|\\n|Time series regression II (studies of longer term associations)|Studies have explored in particular the association of medium-term weather cycles such as ENSO with disease. Methods options are as for other TSRs, though specifics not.|These have some advantages over TSR of short term associations in being closer to studying association of climate change on health, although they are subject to similar potential biases and their time scales are below the many-decade scale of anthropogenic climate change.|\\n|Spatial Analysis (Cluster Analysis, Geographic information systems (GIS))|Most spatial methods cover three main areas: Descriptive or visual presentation of disease data (choropleth maps, GIS), tests for global or local clustering (Moran’s I, spatial scan statistics) and analysing point data to estimate the intensity of spatial processes (kriging, splines).|These methods allow the examination of disease risk in relation to space, time and space-time and also allow the interpolation of data points from limited sampling data.|\\n|Spatial Time Series Regression|Spatial time series regression (also called spatio-temporal regression) explores the dependence of infectious disease outcomes with weather when both are measured in units varying over both space and time.|Spatial time series regression maximises contrasts in exposure (variance) when data with both space and time are available. Its main challenges are to control for both spatially and temporally varying confounding variables and autocorrelation.|\\n|Other Hybrid time series-PBM studies|A few studies employed Hybrid time series-PBM studies. These are applications of “time series susceptible-infectious-recovered (immune)” (TSIR) PBMs incorporating dependence of force of infection on weather.|We believe that these approaches have promise to inform dependence of disease on climate and climate change.|\\n|Bayesian Approach/Markov Chain Monte Carlo|An introduction on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, usually associated with Bayesian analysis, is presented. These methods are becoming increasingly popular as they allow estimations of parameters and associated uncertainties for large classes of complex models for which standard estimation is difficult if not impossible.|These methods are particularly suitable in the presence of complex mechanistic or statistical approaches with many unknown parameters (mirroring the complex impact of weather and/or climate change on water-associated diseases). An important limitation is the computational power required for some models.

The compartmental models in our Review included an additional compartment describing the dynamic of the pathogen population in the environment (e.g., the concentration of the pathogen in the water reservoir) which is then linked in some way to temperature and/or rainfall factors (e.g., rainfall affects the volume of the water reservoir, which determines the dilution of the pathogen and, thus, the probability of contracting the disease; temperature affects the growth and survival of many free-living pathogens, such as E. coli, in the water reservoir). An infection occurs when a susceptible person comes in contact with this additional category. Infected people can excrete pathogens, and feedback into the environment compartment (included in the majority of the PBM-papers), although for some infections there is no excretion and thus no feedback into the environment (e.g., Legionella). Ten percent of PBM-papers also included person-to-person transmission via contacts between susceptible and infected persons. The cluster PBM also contained sub-clusters: “Exposure–Response Relationship”, “Stability Analysis”, “Human Mobility”, and “Network Analysis” (Fig 5). Important features of the clusters are discussed in Table 3.\\n\\n# Cluster TS-SE\\n\\nTime series regression (TSR) analysis [15,17] is one of the most common methods used by the papers reviewed to analyse temperature and rainfall exposures as they can vary over time. Many studies used generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) often included terms allowing for over-dispersion. Terms to control for seasonality (time stratified model, Fourier terms, spline functions) and autocorrelation terms are often included. In most cases, residual variation in the response variable (e.g., daily counts of disease occurrence) was modelled as a Poisson distribution, followed by negative binomial. The most common exposure factors were temperature and rainfall. Socio-economic indicators were often included in the analysis.\\n\\nAs noted in the systematic review of Imai and Hashizume [15], only a few studies included variations in the susceptible population over time, due to, for instance, changes in immunity following disease recovery. Autoregressive models (e.g., ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, ARIMAX), which intrinsically take into account correlation, were used in some studies (Fig 6), although many studies in the regression tradition used ad hoc approaches for this. These methods were often used to investigate the temporal lag between the exposure and the response variable (e.g., daily counts of disease occurrence).\\n\\n# Spatial Methods\\n\\nSpatial methods for linking datasets use geographical information systems (GIS) to link disease data with information on socio-economic indicators, temperature and rainfall (or proxy indicators), and vegetation and land use data within the same geographical framework.

Only 9% of the reviewed papers applied the methodology to study the effects of climate, i.e., long-term averages of weather such as El Niño cycles (these applications are not mutually exclusive); and 7% used modelled future climate projections. Collinearity of exposures, i.e., highly correlated predictor variables in regression models, is an important limitation in weather and climate studies but was only explicitly identified as a limitation in 7% of studies.\\n\\n# Method Dependence on Disease/Pathogen\\n\\nApproximately 50% of papers investigating Vibrio cholerae employed methods based on...\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n# 1. Overview of Methods\\n\\nCompartmental models, followed by time-series/regression analysis and spatial/GIS analysis using cholera case observations, were commonly employed. Similar patterns were observed for unspecified water-associated pathogens. For generic diarrheal pathogens, where there is much more uncertainty about the causes, spatial/GIS and time-series/regression analysis were the most commonly used methods.\\n\\n# 2. Key Features in the Methods\\n\\nMore than 70% of studies included observed or modeled temperature and/or rainfall/precipitation data in their analysis. A smaller proportion of studies included other environmental factors (e.g., relative humidity, vapor air pressure, evaporation) and socio-economic indicators (e.g., access to water, index of poverty, age, education, human mobility).\\n\\nAround 40% of the methods explicitly included the effects of seasonality (intra-annual climate variability). A small proportion of papers (7%) included the effects of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO). Almost 40% of the methods took into account spatial variation. Only a small proportion of the methods explicitly modeled the pathogen dynamics in the wider environment or the specific water reservoir.\\n\\n# 3. Assessment of Results\\n\\nThe statistical methods used to fit a model with the observed data were assessed with information criteria (such as Akaike Information Criterion, AIC and Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC) in almost 20% of cases. In a significant proportion of papers (10%), the validation of the method was based on out-of-sample predictions. In some cases, there was no assessment of the methods.\\n\\n# 4. Method Limitations\\n\\nThe lack of inclusion of relevant factors in the methods was the most common limitation acknowledged by the authors. These included spatial and socio-economic heterogeneity, seasonality, changing immunity, and other environmental drivers. In almost 20% of papers, the authors identified reporting bias as a key limitation.\\n\\nThe poor quality of the data was another important source of limitation according to the authors, explicitly mentioned in around 30% of reviewed papers. Typical examples of poor data quality included low spatio-temporal resolution of the exposure data, lack of longitudinal data, and low accuracy of the data.\\n\\nIn 10% of cases, the methods were not able to explain the observed patterns in the disease outcome. The authors identified the absence of underlying mechanistic explanation as a problem in about 10% of the studies. Additionally, in 10% of papers, the authors highlighted that the methods were calibrated only for a specific situation, limiting the generalizability of the findings.\\n\\nFigure 7: Environmental Factors Included in the Analysis\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: smaller;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n# Synthesis: Seven Challenges in Developing Methods for Quantifying the Effects of Weather and Climate on Water-Associated Diseases\\n\\n# 1) Disentangling Multiple Transmission Pathways'),\n",

The spread of many pathogens is subjected to concurrent modes of transmission. For instance, cholera can be acquired from contamination of household water storage containers, food preparation, direct person-to-person contacts, and/or via contact with environmental reservoirs with long pathogen persistence [22,23]. Identifying a potential signature for the particular pathways in the patterns of diseases is perhaps the ideal goal.\\n\\nTo separate person-to-person transmission from other modes of disease transmission, a range of methods have been proposed, including nonlinear time series approaches linked with wavelet analysis [24] and mechanistic compartmental approaches [22,23]. Despite such efforts, isolating the contributions of person-to-person transmission on the burden of these diseases remains a compelling problem not only for water-associated diseases but for all infectious diseases [25,26].\\n\\nDifferent transmission pathways can be strongly affected by weather and/or climate. For example, temperature may have direct effects on Salmonella bacterial proliferation at various stages in the food chain, including bacterial loads on raw food production, transport, and inappropriate storage. Indirect effects on eating behaviors during hot days may also occur [27]. Rainfall might increase person-to-environment transmission of cholera by facilitating the contamination of fresh water from the sewage system. Conversely, rainfall might dilute the concentrations of pathogens, reducing environment-to-person transmission [28].\\n\\nCompartmental models have also been used to investigate the effects of pathogen dilution due to the seasonal variation of water volume (e.g., with monsoons) and the potential interactions with other environmental drivers (e.g., temperature [29,30] and the effects of human mobility) [31].\\n\\nThe key challenge ahead is increasing awareness of the drivers of disease and achieving a deeper integration with fields such as microbiology (e.g., identifying dose-response curves to use as input for modeling, potential coexistence of human-to-human transmission), social science (e.g., to identify and include in the methods social contacts, patterns of mobility, adaptation, etc.), and ecology (e.g., to understand and incorporate the dynamics of free-living organisms in water).\\n\\n# 2) Reducing Uncertainty in Reporting\\n\\nMeasuring the ‘true’ incidence of disease, and therefore morbidity and mortality rates, is a common problem in epidemiology. This includes under-ascertainment arising when not all cases seek healthcare, under-reporting due to failures in the surveillance system, and reporting bias [32,33]. Community-based studies have been employed to reduce the uncertainty in reporting a range of diseases, including water-associated diseases [34].\\n\\nThese methods usually involve the acquisition of data, e.g., by questionnaire possibly accompanied by biological sampling (e.g., serological surveys), in a representative population such as retrospective cohorts or population cross-sections. These methods can be integrated with statistical and mathematical approaches to estimate incidence. For a review of these methods, see [34] and references therein.\\n\\nA common problem with these methods is that they are sensitive to the particular situation under investigation, such as country, age, and social group. Additionally, climate and/or weather can have a direct impact on reporting. For example, impassable roads reducing the ability to seek medical care during the rainy season might explain the apparent seasonality of incidence of Lassa fever in humans in Sierra Leone [35]. This underscores the importance of integrating a variety of approaches, including not only serology, lab-based sampling, and statistical/mathematical models, but also participatory modeling and ethnographic research [36] to assess perceptions of risk and approaches to hygiene.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nHealth-seeking behaviour and accessibility; and how economic and social factors affect the reliability of data collection by, or reporting to, the surveillance system [35–37].\\n\\n# Identifying the Key Risk Factors/Disease Determinants and Tackling Collinearity\\n\\nA key task is often to detect the main risk factors or disease determinants, and quantify their impacts. A closely related problem is collinearity (also called multi-collinearity), i.e. the situation where two or more predictor variables in a statistical model are linearly related. Collinearity might generate numerical problems, i.e. instability of parameter estimates and inflated variance of the estimated regression coefficient. In particular, collinearity often makes it impossible to attribute the effects on the response variable to the individual predictor variables [38].\\n\\nThis is part of the wider epistemological problem of association vs. causation, which is not discussed here and we refer the interested reader to, for instance, the Bradford-Hill guidelines [39].\\n\\nIn our context, a common source of collinearity is the highly correlated climatic variables such as temperature and rainfall. In some cases, collinearity can have a limited impact on inference, if the correlation between variables remains unchanged [40]. Patterns of collinearity between climatic variables, however, strongly depend on geographic location and environment (e.g. eco-zones) [38]; and they might vary in time due to climate change. This prevents meaningful interpretation/extrapolation of the findings beyond the geographic or environmental range of sampled data.\\n\\nWe share the view of Dormann et al. [38] that without a mechanistic understanding of the biophysical process, collinear variables cannot be separated by statistical means alone. This requires an understanding of the relationships between the different predictor variables, e.g. the dependence of humidity on temperature and rainfall [41], or between the response variable and one or more predictor variables, e.g. the dependence of Salmonella growth on temperature.\\n\\nSuch mechanistic insights are not always available and one must rely on solely statistical approaches. Under this scenario, Dormann et al. [38] conducted a systematic review of methods to deal with collinearity and a simulation study evaluating their performance (in absence of mechanistic understanding) with regard to robust model fitting and prediction.\\n\\nThe methodologies assessed in [38], for detecting and removing collinearities include clustering (e.g. Principal Component Analysis-based Clustering, Iterative Variance Inflation Factor Analysis), cluster-independent methods (e.g. Selection of Uncorrelated Variables, Sequential Regression), latent variable regressions (e.g. Principal Component Regression, Partial Least Squares, Dimension Reduction Techniques), and a range of approaches that may be less sensitive to collinearity (e.g. Penalised Regressions, Machine-Learning methods, Collinearity-Weighted Regression). Fourier analysis is another approach that, from each time series of predictors, extracts a set of orthogonal data to be used as new descriptor uncorrelated variables [18,42].\\n\\nBayesian Network Analysis is another promising tool to identify statistical dependencies between multiple variables, and to separate these into those directly and indirectly dependent with one or more response variables [43]. This data-driven statistical tool produces a graphical network, whose structure describes the interdependency between variables [43,44]. In contrast with Path Analysis [45], Bayesian network analysis does not assume any causal relationships although this can be introduced by appropriate prior distribution for the structure of the graphical network. In particular, the method has been applied to investigate socio-economic determinants for diarrheal diseases and the role of weather in animal diseases [43,46].\\n\\nAnother method, applied to the 1993 Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak [47], integrates population dynamic models with Profile Likelihood approach [48].

The method, which is suitable for a limited subset of the parameters, provides a better understanding of the relationship among different parameters.\\n\\n# Identifying and Quantifying Temporal Lags\\n\\nIdentifying and quantifying the different sources of the temporal lag from the start of the pathway to infection to disease detection is crucial. The effects of various meteorological, climatic, environmental, and socio-economic factors on the occurrence of disease are not instantaneous. Sources of the temporal lag include:\\n\\n- The time required for potential growth of pathogen population in the environment\\n- Exposure dynamics\\n- Incubation period\\n- Delays in reporting\\n\\nFurther complications can arise from feedback from the infected population to the pathogen reservoir (e.g., rainfall facilitating contamination of fresh water from the sewage system). The required time tres for the pathogen population in the reservoir to replicate and reach a sufficient value to cause infections depends on a range of environmental and microbiological factors specific to the pathogen under investigation.\\n\\n# Estimating Time and Its Distribution\\n\\nMethods to estimate this time and its distribution are beyond the scope of this review; here we simply mention some mechanistic approaches and a separate published review for temperature-driven bacterial growth in food and in water drinking systems. The required time texp for susceptible individuals to be infected after being exposed to the pathogen reservoir depends on the particular route of transmission and type of exposure.\\n\\n# Microbial Risk Assessment Framework\\n\\nThe literature on microbial risk assessment framework (hazard identification, dose-response relationships, exposure assessment, quantitative risk characterization) represents an important source of methods to estimate the probability of infection and disease resulting from exposure to a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. The effect of exposure events is, in general, distributed over a time interval. A range of approaches, based on time series analysis, has been implemented to study the distributed effects of multiple episodes of exposure on infectious outbreaks.\\n\\n# Challenges in Estimating Time Lags\\n\\nInfections are typically revealed after the incubation period, tinc, which is associated with the patient’s physiology, whose distribution depends on the type of infection. After symptoms start, only a proportion of the infected individuals seeks medical assistance, and for only a proportion of these cases will further diagnostic testing be conducted and recorded in the public health system. This introduces a further time lag, tdet, between the time when an infected individual approaches the health system and the actual appropriate laboratory detection with diagnosis.\\n\\nEven in a simple scenario, the temporal lag between the start of the pathway to infection and disease detection is a combination of the time lags tres, texp, tinc, and tdet. These are typically represented by random variables drawn from adequate distributions; for example, a log-normal distribution has been proposed for tinc and tdet.\\n\\n# Key Challenges\\n\\nKey challenges include:\\n\\n- These distributions are expected to be dependent on a range of factors (patient’s physiology, environment, reporting bias).\\n- They are not necessarily stationary.\\n- Technical difficulties inherent with the algebra of random variables.\\n\\nEstimating the time lag between environmental/climatic variables and infections was a common task encountered in this review; however, none of the methods used distinguished the different sources of time lag. In most cases, the assessment was based on trial and error methods, typically searching for high correlation between the time series of incidence and the time series of temperature and/or rainfall at various weeks before the date of reported cases, followed by some significance tests or selection criteria.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n# Key Variables in Research\\n\\nFig 7. The most common environmental and socio-economic variables included in the reviewed papers.\\n\\n# Community Involvement in Research\\n\\nInvolving the wider community via community-based studies and citizen science could help in identifying the different sources of the temporal lag from the start of the pathway to infection to disease detection. This information could be used as inputs for agent-based models (ABM) to simulate controlled processes in epidemics, and to assess the capability of these models to identify the multiple sources (physiology, environment, behaviour) of time lags and their statistical distributions.\\n\\n# Pathogen Evolution and Climate Change\\n\\nStudying the evolution of pathogens in response to climate change/variability is crucial. Very little research has investigated the potential effect of observed climate change/variability on these pathogens.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nThe evolution and adaptation of pathogens are influenced by changes in climate (e.g., mean temperature and rainfall, patterns of seasonality, etc.) over decadal time scales. In particular, seasonality is expected to be an important driver of pathogen evolution, as periods of high transmission are followed by population bottlenecks that reduce strain diversity and cause rapid genetic shifts. Furthermore, external periodic perturbations (e.g., seasonality in temperature, rainfall) can resonate with the natural frequencies of the ecosystem, promoting the emergence or suppression of particular strains of the pathogen. Apart from the theoretical work of Koelle et al. which might explain the cholera strain replacement in Bangladesh due to changes in monsoon rainfall patterns, we are not aware of further research investigating the evolution of water-associated pathogens in response to climate change.\\n\\n# Investigating the Effects of Time-Varying Factors on Transmission Patterns\\n\\nThe importance of and challenges in understanding the effects of seasonal drivers and climate variability on the dynamics of infectious diseases are largely recognized. Further challenges arise from potential changes in seasonal patterns of the drivers, for example due to control measures, and aperiodic time-varying factors. Stability analysis for seasonal systems, i.e., studying the conditions for pathogen invasion and establishment in systems characterized by fluctuating environmental forcing, represents an interesting area for future research.\\n\\n# Dealing with Different Spatio-Temporal Scales\\n\\nThe mechanistic approaches reviewed here were, in most cases, deterministic compartmental models, which are strictly only valid for large epidemics. Water-associated disease outbreaks could be point-source, affecting a relatively small population. For this situation, stochastic process-based models coupled with local weather and environmental variables could be beneficial. Quantitative methodological studies applied to longer-term climatic effects are limited.

The effects of Earth\\'s atmosphere range from short-term weather events to intermediate time periods like ENSO, to longer-term climate change. We are not aware of any unified approach linking together the effects of the different time-scales on water-associated infectious diseases and their spatial distribution. Spatial analysis was often performed on a temporal snapshot, usually to find correlation among different variables in different locations. Only a small proportion of spatial studies included temporal dynamics, for example, to study the spread of cholera in a particular region due to rainfall. Longer-term changes, such as land use changes, were rarely incorporated.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nA range of diverse methods are used to study the effect of weather and climate on water-associated diseases. Most of these methods can be connected to two main groups: (i) process-based models (PBM), and (ii) time series and spatial epidemiology. In general, PBMs were employed when the bio-physical mechanism of transmission of the pathogen was known (as with Vibrio cholerae, the most studied pathogen). PBMs describe the progression of the infectious diseases by mimicking the bio-physical processes, typically in terms of non-linear differential equations. In contrast, statistically-oriented approaches (such as regression analysis over space or over time) tended to be used when the roles of specific environmental drivers were unclear.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nThis research paper discusses the challenges associated with methods for investigating water-associated diseases and the necessary methodologies to identify potential correlations between environmental and socio-economic variables and infection patterns.\\n\\nThe two clusters of studies resemble explanatory and predictive models. While acknowledging the significance of the philosophical debate surrounding these models, we opted against a formal classification of the studies. Implementing the guidelines provided by Shmueli in a rigorous and objective manner proved particularly challenging in our context. For instance, many modeling studies provide maps of disease risk by calculating the Basic Reproductive Number, a tool typically used in explanatory compartmental models based on \"First Principles.\" This raises the question: should these models be classified as predictive or explanatory?\\n\\nTable 3 discusses the use, or potential use, of the reviewed methodologies to investigate the effects of weather and climate. Most studies focused on short-term weather effects, as time series of health data are more readily available.\\n\\nDisentangling the individual effects of multiple abiotic factors (e.g., weather, climate, environmental, demographic, and socio-economic) on the incidence of water-associated infectious diseases presents a significant challenge. Additional methodological issues arise from the limited understanding of complex bio-physical mechanisms, the concurrent effects of correlated factors, poor data quality, reporting bias, and uncertainty regarding relevant parameters. These limitations are intrinsic to the methods and data available. Addressing these challenges could facilitate the development of a framework to understand the overall effects of weather, climate, and other environmental and socio-economic factors on water-associated infectious diseases.\\n\\nThis research shares common limitations with any systematic review. A notable limitation is the possibility of missing relevant studies, potentially due to search engine failures or studies published in languages other than English. This issue could be partially mitigated through snowballing procedures, which involve recursively pursuing relevant references cited in retrieved literature. However, this technique is less feasible when the initial pool of documents is as large as in this case.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, given the high number of studies included in this review, we anticipate that the general patterns in our findings are robust. We acknowledge that methods developed for other classes of infectious diseases (e.g., vector-borne diseases) may be relevant to our context but were not included in our analysis. The protocol of our review was designed to ensure the objectivity and reproducibility of the results and the research question identified.\\n\\n# Recommendations for Future Research\\n\\nThe selection of a particular method in a study is influenced by various factors, including the scientific background of the researchers involved. Anecdotally, we observed that most predictive Bayesian models (PBM) are employed by scientists from engineering or physics departments. The ease of implementing methods (e.g., using freely available statistical packages) and the tendency to utilize widely accepted methods, known as the Matthew Effect, also play a role in this selection process.\\n\\nMethod choice should be guided by multiple factors, including scientific questions, data availability, transmission pathways, and bio-physical and socio-economic mechanisms, as well as the current state of the art in methods. These factors should be critically assessed on a case-by-case basis rather than relying on oversimplified, prescriptive guidelines. The findings of this review can aid scientists in the critical selection and development of methods for quantifying the effects of weather and climate on water-associated diseases.\\n\\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659 | June 12, 2017\\n---\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh2 {\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\np {\\ncolor: #444;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #888;\\n}\\n\\n# Challenges with Methods for Water-Associated Disease\\n\\n# Tackling the Many Challenges\\n\\nImportant data and theoretical challenges emerged with implications for the surveillance and control of water-associated infections. The inter-connections between human health, the environment, and also animal health as advocated by the One Health holistic vision [82], are increasingly recognized. Being aware of these connections and the potential bio-physical mechanisms occurring at different spatio-temporal scales is crucial to separate out the multiple transmission pathways, to understand and quantify the different sources of the temporal lag, and to deal with collinearity. Incorporating information on human behaviour and socio-economic factors can help to reduce reporting bias, and improve understanding of the potential effect on infectious diseases of anthropogenic climate change and interventions.\\n\\n# Collecting and Linking Long Term, High-Resolution Data\\n\\nThe integration of infection data with long-term, national-scale, environmental and land use data is an important growing approach [83]. For example, the national communicable diseases database of Public Health England has collected data from microbiology diagnostic laboratories (as well as patient’s addresses in the last five years) for England and Wales since 1989. The location of the diagnostic laboratories, or the patient residences, could be used to link cases to local weather parameters supplied by the UK Met Office in a confidential manner. These cases could also be linked with the spatial density of livestock data. The utility of these datasets could be further improved, as most current datasets are one-off surveys. Data on the spatio-temporal infection prevalence in livestock are also important information.\\n\\nThe paucity of this kind of information is much more pronounced for data on wildlife; with the exception of voluntary based schemes (such as citizen science [84]), we are not aware of a systematic collection of such data. Involving the wider public via community-based studies and citizen science could help in reducing the uncertainty in reporting and in identifying the different sources of the temporal lag from the start of the pathway to infection to disease detection. For example, surveys could be used by public health institutions to gather data on patient behaviour, symptom onset, food and water exposures, the likelihood of seeking medical advice, and the location of the potential sources of infection, etc.\\n\\n# Integrating Bio-Physical and Socio-Economic Mechanisms of Infectious Disease'),\n",

These include climate and environmental change, land-use variation, and changes in population and human behaviour. For example, the abundance of long term, high-resolution, surveillance data (e.g. reported infectious diseases from Public Health England) linked with local weather parameters allows the analysis of the subset of epidemiological cases when all environmental variables (except one predictor, referred to as ‘test variable’) are fixed; in this way, the problem of collinearity is naturally removed. This exercise provides a family of curves of the rates of infection, which are function of the test variable and conditioned to all other fixed predictors. From the family of curves, the potential relationship between the predictors and the rate of infection can be inferred and potentially elucidate the bio-physical mechanism.\\n\\nConversely, functional relationships between epidemiological measures (e.g. incidence) and weather parameters arising from process-based models could be used as inputs for statistical models (e.g. by providing a particular relationship for the link function in a GLM).

Although excess summertime campylobacteriosis has been observed, environmental mechanisms driving disease seasonality are poorly understood. We sought to evaluate the relationship between environmental factors and campylobacteriosis risk in a major North American metropolitan area. We evaluated 1532 cases of campylobacteriosis reported in Philadelphia between 1994 and 2007. We constructed Poisson regression models with oscillatory smoothers, and also used case-crossover design, to evaluate the associations between environmental exposures and disease risk on weekly and daily time scales. Both methods control for confounding by seasonally oscillating environmental factors. Incidence was greatest in June and July, with annual periodicity. Weekly incidence was associated with increasing relative humidity, (incidence rate ratio (IRR) per % 1.017, 95% CI 1.008–1.025), temperature (IRR per °C 1.041, 95% CI 1.011–1.072), and decreasing Delaware River temperature during the same week (IRR per °C 0.922, 95% CI 0.883–0.962), and at 4-week lags (IRR per °C 0.953, 95% CI 0.919–0.990). No acute associations were identified in case-crossover analyses. Our findings affirm the summertime seasonality of campylobacteriosis in Philadelphia, and the link between warm, humid weather and disease risk. However, the link between low river temperatures and enhanced campylobacteriosis risk in humans described here is novel, consistent with known links between watershed temperature and Campylobacter survival, and implicates local watersheds as epidemiologically important reservoirs for foodborne pathogens.\\n\\nKey words: Campylobacter, epidemiology, environment, meteorological factors, regression analysis, case-control studies\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nSince their initial description in the early 1960s, Campylobacter species have emerged as a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis...\\n\\n© 2009 International Association for Ecology and Health\\n---\\n# Environmental Determinants of Campylobacteriosis Risk\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental Determinants of Campylobacteriosis Risk\\n\\nBacterial gastroenteritis is a significant health concern in both developed and developing countries (Allos and Taylor, 1998). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that in the United States, 2.4 million people suffer from campylobacteriosis each year (Friedman et al., 2000). In addition to abdominal pain, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), and nausea and vomiting (Allos and Taylor, 1998), uncommon complications of campylobacteriosis include Guillain-Barre syndrome (McCarthy and Giesecke, 2001), reactive arthritis (Hannu et al., 2002), and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (Ternhag et al., 2008). The disease occurs in a seasonal pattern in North America, Scandinavia, Europe, and New Zealand, with peak incidence occurring during the spring and summer months (Kapperud and Aasen, 1992; Nylen et al., 2002; Kovats et al., 2005; Louis et al., 2005; Meldrum et al., 2005).\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis has been linked most commonly to consumption of contaminated food such as poultry (Harris et al., 1986; Eberhart et al., 1997; Meldrum et al., 2005), but also to unpasteurized milk (Frost, 2001), raw seafood (Frost, 2001; ProMED-mail, 2008), and contaminated drinking water sources (Aho et al., 1989; Melby et al., 1991; Andersson et al., 1997; Richardson et al., 2007). Interventions have been directed at reducing foodborne transmission, and incidence has slowly decreased in the US over the past decade (Allos, 2001). However, the etiology underlying most cases remains unknown (Rodrigues et al., 2001; Tam et al., 2006), and the driving forces behind disease seasonality have yet to be elucidated. The marked seasonality of disease incidence suggests that underlying environmental factors could play a role in driving disease transmission or bacterial infectivity (Fisman, 2007).\\n\\n# Objective\\n\\nOur objective was to investigate how environmental factors influence Campylobacter infection in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, a large urban U.S. county. We used both traditional analytic methods (i.e., Poisson regression with oscillatory smoothers) and a novel case-crossover method to examine the effects of acute weather fluctuations on Campylobacter disease occurrence. Both methods reduce or eliminate confounding by seasonally varying environmental, behavioral, and infectious influences, and changes in laboratory and clinical practice that might otherwise distort the observed magnitude of environmental effects on disease risk (Talbot et al., 2005; Fisman, 2007).\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Case Data\\n\\nPhiladelphia County (conterminous with the City of Philadelphia, population 1,517,550 in 2000) receives its public health services from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health (PDPH). We evaluated “confirmed” cases of campylobacteriosis occurring in Philadelphia County between 1994 and 2007; cases are considered confirmed when there is laboratory isolation of any Campylobacter species from a clinical specimen (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). Confirmed cases are enumerated in PDPH surveillance records, and are reported to the laboratory-based surveillance system managed by the Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). Available information on cases included event date (i.e., the earliest known date at which infection occurred), age, sex, race/ethnicity, bacterial species (if known), and census tract of residence. Demographic data obtained from the US Census Bureau were used to calculate disease rates for the city as a whole, and by census tract (American Fact Finder, 2008).\\n\\n# Environmental Exposure Data\\n\\nMeteorological data including temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation for the period from 1994 to 2007 were obtained from the weather station at Philadelphia International Airport, located 8 km southwest of Philadelphia’s city center (National Climate Data Center, 2007). UV index forecast estimates for Philadelphia during the same period were retrieved from the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center (2007). Data pertaining to the Delaware River and its major tributaries were obtained from the National Water Information System division of the US Geological Survey and included: temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen; river levels in the Schuylkill River (another major river and source of drinking water in Philadelphia); and log-transformed discharges of tributaries, including the Frankford, Poquessing, and Pennypack Creeks, and the Schuylkill River, into the Delaware River (USGS Water Resources for the United States, 2008).\\n---\\n# Statistical Methods and Results of Campylobacteriosis Study\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.equation {\\nfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder-left: 3px solid #007BFF;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Statistical Methods and Results of Campylobacteriosis Study\\n\\n# Statistical Methods\"),\n",

The fast Fourier transform was used to spectrally decompose the data and create a periodogram in order to evaluate the seasonality of disease occurrence (Diggle, 1990; Fisman, 2007).\\n\\nBased on evidence for annual periodicity of disease occurrence, we estimated seasonal and longer-term year-on-year trends of campylobacteriosis occurrence using two orthogonal sinusoidal oscillators with 52-week (i.e., annual) periods to smooth the data (Diggle, 1990; Jensen et al., 2003). Thus, the expression for expected number of case counts in a given week, E(Y), is described by:\\n\\nE(Y) = exp(a + b1(year) + b2(sin(2π week/52)) + b3(cos(2π week/52)))\\n\\nAn estimate of the timing of peak incidence can be obtained by taking the arctangent of b2/b3 (Diggle, 1990). We also used a less restrictive approach to smoothing, based on the introduction of natural cubic splines to represent both long-term trends, as well as seasonal variance. We specified the number of knots to be assigned to the interpolating splines; increasing the number of knots allows for a better fit with the data. To avoid the pitfalls associated with both overfitting and underfitting, Akaike’s information criterion was used to optimize the number of knots within the spline model (Akaike, 1970).\\n\\nThe influence of environmental exposures on Campylobacter incidence was evaluated individually and with a backwards elimination algorithm, keeping terms with P < 0.15.\\n\\nWe also evaluated acute, short-term effects of fluctuations in meteorological conditions on disease risk using a case-crossover approach. This approach allows associations between brief, transient exposures and relatively rare outcomes to be evaluated. For the purposes of this environmental analysis, “cases” are days on which campylobacteriosis cases occurred, while “controls” are appropriately selected days on which the “case” did not occur (Fisman et al., 2005).\\n\\nA time-stratified 2:1 matched case-crossover design was used in which hazard periods were defined as the reported date of disease onset from the PDPH. Beginning on October 1, 1994, the person–time at risk was divided into 3-week time strata. To choose control periods, we matched the hazard period by day of the week within the stratum. The control periods could both precede, both follow, or straddle the hazard period (Lumley and Levy, 2000; Levy et al., 2001). Directionality of control selection was random in order to avoid biases that can occur with unidirectional or uniform bidirectional control selection (Levy et al., 2001).\\n\\nThe 2–5-day incubation period of C. jejuni was used to estimate the lag days between acute environmental occurrence and case onset (a.k.a., the plausible effect period) (Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 2000).\\n\\nAnalyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), Stata version 9.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX), and ArcMap version 9.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Descriptive Epidemiology\\n\\nA total of 1513 cases of acute campylobacteriosis were reported in Philadelphia County between December 1, 1994 and April 30, 2007, of which 1477 were confirmed. A crude incidence of 8.25 cases per 100,000 population per year was observed, with highest incidence in individuals aged 0–4 and in the late 20s (Fig. 1). Males were slightly more commonly affected than females (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.01–1.35), and cases occurred with higher incidence in whites than non-whites (IRR 2.05, 95% CI 1.74–2.44).\\n\\nThere was no statistically significant association between disease risk and median census tract household income, and no graphical evidence for clustering of disease by county region or census tract.\\n\\nOf the 524 cases with Campylobacter speciation, 483 (92.2%) were C. jejuni, 27 (5.2%) were C. coli, 8 (1.5%) were C. fetus, and 6 (1.2%) were C. lari. There were no recorded cases of infection with multiple Campylobacter species. There was no significant association between species type and age or sex.\\n\\nSpectral decomposition via a fast Fourier transform revealed a strong annual periodicity, with a phase shift of 27 weeks, indicating maximal incidence in early July (Fig. 2). Poisson regression models incorporating sine and cosine terms affirmed strong seasonal behavior (P for seasonal oscillation < 0.001). A marked annual decrease in incidence was observed throughout the study period (IRR: 0.93 per year, 95% CI 0.92–0.95, P < 0.001).\\n---\\n# Environmental Determinants of Campylobacteriosis Risk\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental Determinants of Campylobacteriosis Risk\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter species remain the most commonly identified enteric pathogen (Allos, 2001). Campylobacteriosis is largely understood to be a foodborne illness, but traditional risk factor analyses have failed to explain the majority of cases, and are insufficient to explain the marked summertime seasonality that occurs in developed countries (Louis et al., 2005).\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nUsing analytic approaches that control for known and unknown seasonally occurring confounders, we found that environmental conditions influence the incidence of campylobacteriosis on a weekly time scale.

We do not suggest that the hydrological effects identified here represent an uncomplicated causal pathway involving consumption of contaminated drinking water from the Delaware River system. Although Campylobacter species have been isolated from surface waters throughout North America (Taylor et al., 1983; Carter et al., 1987), and it has been shown by Schwartz and colleagues that small changes in the turbidity of treated drinking water in Philadelphia County are associated with significant surges in risk of diarrheal disease in both children and older adults (Schwartz et al., 1997, 2000), sewage and drinking water treatment should reduce the risk of waterborne campylobacteriosis. Furthermore, the 4-week lag between river measurements and surges in risk identified in our first multivariable model are inconsistent with the known incubation period for campylobacteriosis (Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 2000).\\n\\nRather, we would suggest that local surface waters (which are abundant in a city like Philadelphia, famously situated at the confluence of two major river systems) may serve as an important environmental reservoir for pathogenic Campylobacter species. Although most campylobacteriosis has long been assumed to be foodborne, and the abundance of Campylobacter species in food animals oscillates in a manner consistent with summertime seasonality (Wallace et al., 1997; Stanley et al., 1998; Hudson et al., 1999), a recent study by Meldrum and colleagues (2005) found that summertime peak rates of colonization in retail poultry actually lagged behind rates in humans in the United Kingdom, suggesting a common, environmental reservoir for infection. We suggest that local surface waters might represent such a reservoir.\\n\\nThe mechanism whereby Campylobacter species might transit from this environmental reservoir to food items (and thus to human gastrointestinal tracts) is suggested by the shorter-term associations between campylobacteriosis risk and increased temperature and humidity. Such weather conditions have been linked by Nichols (2005) to markedly reduced generation times for fly larvae. The resulting surfeit of flies in summer months could be sufficient to explain the recognized summertime surge in campylobacteriosis risk, if contaminated flies serve to inoculate foodstuffs (Nichols, 2005). Fly contamination could occur, for example, via contact with Campylobacter contained in animal feces, or via direct contact with surfaces contaminated by Campylobacter (e.g., near rivers or streams). Dogs and cats, rodents, and pigeons are all animal species that are abundant.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nAlexander N. J. White et al. discuss the prevalence of pathogenic Campylobacter species in urban areas such as Philadelphia. These areas can be colonized by these pathogens, and individuals may become infected through the consumption of untreated water from local rivers and streams. The study highlights the potential for direct contamination of flies via contact with the physical environment and animal feces, which could explain the observed associations between river temperature and disease risk at variable lags. Additionally, humidity has been shown to increase Campylobacter colonization and survival rates in eggs and poultry.\\n\\nDemographic risk factors for campylobacteriosis were also identified, with young children (ages 4 and under) being at the greatest risk, followed by individuals in their mid- to late-20s. This finding is consistent with previous reports. The bimodal age peak in incidence may be attributed to poor food preparation skills in younger individuals, enhanced exposure due to child-rearing, sexual transmission, or waning Campylobacter-specific immunity, warranting further exploration. The incidence estimates for Philadelphia County were lower than national estimates for the United States, which may be due to the predominantly urban environment or underreporting of this common gastrointestinal infection.\\n\\nThe study acknowledges limitations, particularly the reliance on public health surveillance data, which is known to suffer from underreporting. Estimates suggest that for every reported case of campylobacteriosis, there are between 20 and 50 cases in the community. However, underreporting will only bias the results towards the null hypothesis if it correlates with meteorological and hydrological variables, which is considered unlikely. Weather data were obtained from a single site, which may not accurately represent individual exposure status, likely leading to conservative estimates of the observed effects.\\n\\nIn summary, the occurrence of campylobacteriosis in a major US urban center was described, revealing marked summertime seasonality potentially explained by increased temperature and humidity. Local watershed conditions, particularly temperature, appear to influence summertime campylobacteriosis risk, consistent with the enhanced survival of Campylobacter species in cooler waters. The findings support emerging models of disease transmission that involve interactions between the physical environment and both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAho M, Kurki M, Rautelin H, Kosunen TU (1989) Waterborne outbreak of Campylobacter enteritis after outdoors infantry drill in Utti, Finland.

Rotavirus accounts for 39% of all cases of severe diarrhoea and over 600,000 deaths each year.\\n\\nUnlike many bacteriological agents of diarrhoeal illness, rotavirus occurs in both temperate and tropical areas. Rotavirus infections are universal diseases of children, regardless of the level of hygiene that prevails or the quality of food and water. Children in developed countries are infected at the same ages and as frequently as those in less developed countries.\\n\\nHowever, an estimated 82% of the 1205 children who die each day from rotavirus disease live in the poorest countries of the world, possibly because of inadequate access to hydration therapy and a greater prevalence of malnutrition. A review of 43 studies from 15 countries on the African continent found rotavirus to be the single most common cause of diarrhoea, responsible for about one-quarter of all diarrhoea cases identified in both hospital patients and outpatients.\\n\\n1 Department of Environmental Science, University of California, Berkeley.\\n\\n2 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, 109 Observatory Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.\\n\\n3 Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 101 Haviland Hall, MC 7358, Berkeley, CA 94720.\\n\\n* Corresponding author.

However, respiratory secretions have also been speculated as a source of transmission in the tropics. Information about the epidemiology and behavior of rotavirus in these countries is needed to ensure high efficacy and safety of the new vaccines.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotaviruses are highly infectious. Replication within the intestinal tract can result in shedding of infectious particles (PFU) per ml (3 x 1011 PFU/oz) of feces, and the infectious dose for the human small intestine has been calculated as only 10 PFU/ml (300 PFU/oz). Rotaviruses are very durable in the environment and can survive for weeks on surfaces and in potable and recreational water.\\n\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus Infections\\n\\nRotavirus exhibits distinct seasonality, known as ‘winter diarrhoea’ in some parts of the world. However, the most recent review of the global seasonality of rotavirus infections concluded that the winter seasonality is too simple a generalization. The authors of this study systematically reviewed 34 epidemiological studies of childhood diarrhoea from a wide range of countries and concluded that globally in temperate zones, rotavirus is certainly more common in the cooler months, but the seasonal peaks can vary broadly.\\n\\n# Climatic Drivers\\n\\nIn the tropics, seasonality may be driven by pressure belts and local air circulation patterns rather than changes in sunlight. Local climatological factors might provide more insight into seasonal patterns of rotavirus infection in this region of the world. Despite inconclusive results for the tropical belt, many authors have referred to clustering during the cool, dry season.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Search Strategy & Selection Criteria\\n\\nStudies published between 1974 and 1988 were identified by Cook et al., and those carried out from 1988 through December 2005 were identified through a PubMed search for ‘rotavirus and season.’ The criteria for study selection included: (i) conducted continuously for 1 year or more; (ii) more than 50 confirmed cases of rotavirus diarrhoea reported; and (iii) monthly data on the proportion of all patients with diarrhoea caused by rotavirus described.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIn an effort to increase our understanding of the transmission and epidemiology of rotavirus disease, this paper updates the knowledge of seasonality of rotavirus infection in tropical countries through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between monthly rotavirus prevalence and climatological variables (temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity).\\n\\nReferences: 1.

Cohort studies were excluded. A total of 26 articles fit these criteria and were included in the analysis presented here. Six papers were excluded because of publication language; these papers were not examined so it is unknown whether they met the other inclusion criteria.\\n\\nAll data reported in the published papers was taken directly from tables or extracted from graphs using DigitizeIt software (I Bormann; www.digitizeit.de). Monthly climatological data for each region were taken from the published paper or from online databases of historical climatological data of the US National Climatic Data Center. Latitude, altitude, average yearly temperature and average yearly rainfall (or number of days of rain per year for the study location) were taken from Weatherbase.\\n\\n# Analysis\\n\\nTo estimate the association of climatological variables and the frequency of rotavirus, univariate generalized log-linear Poisson regression models were carried out for each study location, using monthly data of number of rotavirus cases per month. The inference on the associations was adjusted to account for the possibility of serial dependence of the residuals common problem when time-series are compared by using a Newey regression approach. A 5-month and 12-month lag in residual auto-correlations was assumed for studies that were carried out for less than or equal to and >15 months, respectively; the resulting statistical inference was not sensitive to assumptions on the correlation lag.\\n\\nStudies were also combined to get an overall (average) association between monthly rotavirus incidence (count) and mean temperature, mean rainfall and relative humidity using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, controlling for study-specific variables. Because the climatological variables are highly related to one another, separate analyses were carried out for each.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nA total of 26 studies from 15 countries between latitudes 24°S and 24°N were included in the analysis. These studies took place between 1975 and 2003, with study duration ranging from 1 to 10 years. In some studies, enrolment was limited to children, and in others all ages were included. However, most of the patients were children because of the predominance of rotavirus disease in infants and young children.\\n\\nIn the univariate analyses, an inverse relationship between monthly rotavirus incidence and climatological variables was consistently found in the data; 65%, 55% and 60% of studies showed a significant negative association with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity, respectively. For the same respective variables, only 10%, 18% and 0% had significant positive correlations.\\n---\\n# Summary of Studies included in Review\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Summary of Studies included in Review\\n\\n|Ref.|City|Country|Latitude|Altitude|Avg. yearly rainfall (cm)|Monthly avg. rainfall (cm)|Yearly avg.

The model can be interpreted as a weighted average of individual study estimates to produce a pooled measure of association, the incidence rate ratio (IRR), which is simply interpreted literally—the ratio of mean rates in two different populations that differ by a specified change in the exposure. One can also report the relative effect, or 1-IRR, expressed as a percentage change. These models suggest that on average, across all studies analyzed, for every 1.88°F increase in mean temperature, the incidence of rotavirus decreases by 10% [IRR = 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94); P < 0.0001]; for every 1 cm (0.39 in.) increase in mean monthly rainfall, the incidence of rotavirus decreases by 1% [IRR = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99–1.00); P = 0.001]; and for every 1% increase in relative humidity, the incidence of rotavirus decreases by 3% [IRR = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–1.00); P = 0.018].\\n\\nData not available for every month. The median values for the studies of mean temperature [78°F (12.68°C)], mean monthly rainfall [31 cm (12.2 in.)] and relative humidity (22%) showed reductions in rotavirus incidence of 51% [IRR = 0.49 (95% CI: 0.37–0.65); P < 0.0001], 21% [IRR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69–0.91); P = 0.001], and 44% [IRR = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34–0.90); P = 0.018], respectively.\\n\\nThe meta-analysis revealed significant heterogeneity (P < 0.0001) in studies for all climatological variables assessed. This heterogeneity between studies can be assessed visually in Figure 1, which plots the results of the univariate regression analyses, showing Newey West standard errors. Examining the residual variance of rotavirus incidence in simple random effects models (one for each of the climatological variables of interest) within the random effects (GLS) model, 12–39% of unexplained variation in the model was seen within studies, and 61–88% was seen between studies (Table 2). The most relevant heterogeneity was that for the associations of incidence of rotavirus and climatological variables and this was significant for all the climate variables.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe results of this review suggest that numbers of rotavirus infections tend to be highest under cool, dry conditions in the tropics. Negative associations between monthly rotavirus prevalence and climatological variables analyzed predominate in both the univariate and pooled analyses.

The pooled GEE analysis indicated that low values of all climatological variables predicted increased monthly incidence of rotavirus disease in patients with gastroenteritis.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the majority of studies reviewed were conducted over a relatively short period (2 years or less), which may not adequately capture the effects of seasonality. Studies of longer duration are preferable for establishing the relationship between climate and rotavirus disease.\\n\\nWhile all studies were conducted within the tropics, various climatic regimes exist, which may confound results. The analysis did not account for additional factors such as sanitation and hygiene practices, which could affect rotavirus transmission.\\n\\nStrong evidence suggests that rotavirus is a waterborne pathogen, retaining infectivity in aqueous environments. However, the high rates of infection in early childhood, regardless of sanitary conditions, indicate that water alone may not be responsible for all transmission. Indirect evidence suggests fomites and environmental surfaces may also play a role in spreading rotavirus gastroenteritis.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the heterogeneity observed in the pooled analysis highlights the need for further research to reduce sources of variation and improve predictive power regarding the impact of climatological variables on rotavirus transmission.\\n---\\n                                                                                                                                                   SEASONALITY OF ROTAVIRUS DISEASE  1493\\n\\n                                                 A                                                             Mean Monthly Temperature (ºC)\\n                                                        2.5\\n\\n                                                          2IRRIRRIRR'),\n",

Other evidence also points to a respiratory mode of spread. For example, large outbreaks have been recorded in both mid-Pacific island groups and Native American reservations where affected population groups were widely separated geographically. In both of these cases, each population had its own water supply and the rotavirus epidemic spread rapidly with little or no contact between the various groups.\\n\\nIn the United States, seasonal rotavirus activity occurs in a sequential manner, beginning first in the Southwest from October through December and ending in the Northeast in April or May. This pattern of seasonal spread is similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and measles. Bishop proposes that the explanation for these patterns might lie in the airborne spread of aerosolized particles that are ingested, rather than through the respiratory tract infections.\\n\\nWe speculate that the airborne component of rotavirus transmission might be responsible for the seasonal pattern of rotavirus disease. A relative drop in humidity and rainfall combined with drying of soils in higher temperatures might increase the aerial transport of dried, contaminated fecal material (in the form of droplet nuclei), and might also lead to increased formation of dust, which could provide a substrate for the virus particles. Increased burning of organic materials during the dry season may also increase the amount of particulates in the air.\\n\\nAirborne particles could settle out and infect water supplies or environmental surfaces, or could be ingested. Particles carried on fomites such as clothing could also play a role in large-scale dispersal of rotavirus organisms.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nThe widely cited conclusion of Cook et al. that seasonality of rotavirus infections in the tropics is less distinct than in temperate zones was based on a definition of winter as December–March in the northern hemisphere and June–September in the southern hemisphere. The results of this review suggest that local climatological variables provide a better predictor of seasonality in the tropics, where weather patterns differ from those in the temperate zones. This review reveals a trend for rotavirus to occur in the cool, dry seasons in tropical countries, as observed in temperate zones. These results suggest that paying close attention to local climatic conditions will improve our understanding of the transmission and epidemiology of rotavirus disease.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nNational Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R01AI050038).\\n\\nConflict of interest: None declared.\\n\\n# Key Messages\\n\\n- Incidence of rotavirus disease responds to changes in climate in the tropics, with the highest number of infections found at the colder and drier times of the year.\\n- Monthly rotavirus incidence is significantly negatively correlated with temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity in the majority of studies reviewed.\\n- Rotavirus previously was not thought to respond to seasonal changes in tropical regions of the world.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

Infections in humans and broiler flocks show similar seasonality, suggesting that climate may play a role in infection. We examined the effects of temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and hours of sunlight on Campylobacter incidence in humans and broiler flocks by using lag dependence functions, locally fitted linear models, and cross validation methods. For humans, the best model included average temperature and sunlight 4 weeks prior to infection; the maximum temperature lagged at 4 weeks was the best single predictor. For broilers, the average and maximum temperatures 3 weeks prior to slaughter gave the best estimate; the average temperature lagged at 3 weeks was the best single predictor. The combined effects of temperature and sunlight or the combined effects of temperature and relative humidity predicted the incidence in humans equally well. For broiler flock incidence these factors explained considerably less. Future research should focus on elements within the broiler environment that may be affected by climate, as well as the interaction of microclimatic factors on and around broiler farms. There is a need to quantify the contribution of broilers as a source of campylobacteriosis in humans and to further examine the effect of temperature on human incidence after this contribution is accounted for. Investigations should be conducted into food consumption and preparation practices and poultry sales that may vary by season.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter has become the leading cause of enteric zoonotic infections in most developed and developing countries, and the incidence appears to be increasing. The typical symptoms include diarrhea, which can be bloody, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, headache, and vomiting. The illness is typically self-limiting and usually resolves in about 1 week; however, severe illness and long-term complications, such as arthritis, septicemia, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, sometimes occur. The incidence of human campylobacteriosis in Denmark has risen steadily since 1992, reaching 4,620 cases (86 cases per 100,000 people) in 2001. The majority of cases occur sporadically, and outbreaks are rare. It is estimated that approximately 80% of cases are domestically acquired.\\n\\nCampylobacter is commonly found in domesticated animals, including poultry, cattle, pigs, sheep, cats, and dogs, and in migratory birds, such as ducks and seagulls. Campylobacter has also been isolated from rodents, beetles, houseflies, and surface water sources.\\n\\nMany risk factors for Campylobacter infection have been identified, including consumption of raw or undercooked poultry, handling of raw poultry, contact with chickens or hens, consumption of unpasteurized or contaminated milk or untreated or contaminated drinking water, barbecuing, contact with pets, and international travel. In Denmark, consumption of poultry is thought to be the major risk factor for Campylobacter infections. A national monitoring program estimated the average prevalence of Campylobacter in Danish broiler flocks to be 42% in 2001.\\n\\nIn Denmark, human Campylobacter infections and the percentage of infected broiler flocks show similar seasonal trends, with peak infections occurring in July and August. Seasonal trends in human infection have also been observed in several other countries. These seasonal trends suggest that climatic factors may play a role in infection. Studies have documented an effect of climate, particularly temperature, on human disease. Other studies have suggested associations between environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and sunlight, and Campylobacter carriage in broilers. In this study, we further examined the role of climate on Campylobacter infections by comparing the effects of temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and sunlight on the human incidence in Denmark and on the prevalence of Campylobacter in Danish broiler flocks at slaughter.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nData collection. Human Campylobacter cases reported to the Statens Serum Institute between 1998 and 2001 were summarized by week based on the date that the specimen was received in the laboratory. Our analysis was based on the counties Århus, Bornholm, Frederiksborg, Fyn, Nordjylland, Ribe, Roskilde, Storstrøms, Sønderjylland, Vejle, Vestsjælland, and Viborg and the municipalities Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, which consistently reported incidence by...\\n\\nFor more information, visit Applied and Environmental Microbiology.\\n---\\n# Effects of Climate on Incidence of Campylobacter spp.\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Climate on Incidence of Campylobacter spp.\\n\\nIn a study conducted between 1998 and 2001, a total of 17,941 samples were analyzed, with 6,860 (38%) testing positive for Campylobacter spp.; 85% of these samples contained C. jejuni.\\n\\n# Climate Data\\n\\nClimate data were provided by the Danish Meteorological Institute.

A threshold average temperature above 8°C and a maximum temperature above 13°C were observed; the largest increase in incidence occurred at temperatures up to 20°C, and a smaller increase occurred at temperatures above 20°C. Temperature had its greatest impact 3 to 4 weeks before reported infections for both broilers and humans. The combination of high average temperature and relatively low maximum temperature (i.e., little variation in temperature within 1 week) corresponded to the second highest human incidence and the highest percentage of infected broiler flocks, indicating that it may be the effect of sustained high temperatures rather than intermittent high temperatures that is the key factor in predicting infection. Climatic factors explained a larger proportion of the variance in Campylobacter prevalence in broiler flocks than in humans.\\n\\nFor humans, models that included average temperature and either maximum temperature or hours of sunlight provided the best estimates of Campylobacter incidence. At a lag of 4 weeks, a model that included average and maximum temperatures was nearly consistent with a recent study of Salmonella enterica.\\n---\\n# Effects of Climate on Incidence of Campylobacter spp.\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Climate on Incidence of Campylobacter spp.\\n\\nInfection from Campylobacter spp. can be influenced by various outdoor activities such as picnicking, camping, or swimming, which may increase exposure to environmental sources like lakes and rivers. Some studies suggest that exposure to UV radiation may increase susceptibility to infectious diseases. The mechanisms behind these associations are complex and not fully understood, which should be considered when interpreting Campylobacter results.\\n\\nData on human incidence, broiler flock prevalence, and climate were analyzed nationally, but regional climate variations were not examined. Our analysis did not account for factors other than climate that may influence Campylobacter prevalence. Although individuals with a known history of international travel were excluded from our study, not all participants were interviewed about their travel history, potentially biasing our results.\\n\\nOur study indicated an association between average temperature and relative humidity lagged at 3 weeks. This aligns with findings from Peru, where increased ambient temperature and decreased humidity during an El Niño year correlated with higher hospital admissions for diarrheal illness. However, the mechanisms behind this association remain uncertain, necessitating further research.\\n\\nThe influence of temperature and sunlight on Campylobacter incidence in humans must be balanced with the contribution from broiler meat consumption. In Denmark, poultry consumption is a significant risk factor for campylobacteriosis. While seasonal variations in consumption patterns may exist, they alone do not explain the observed seasonal trends.\\n\\nFor broilers, using average and maximum temperatures from 3 weeks prior to slaughter provided the most accurate estimates of prevalence. A model incorporating average temperature and hours of sunlight was more effective than any single predictor. This is consistent with other studies showing a positive correlation among minimum temperature, hours of sunshine, and Campylobacter carriage in poultry.\\n\\nTemperature may directly influence Campylobacter carriage, or environmental contamination sources may be temperature-dependent. Interestingly, temperature's effect on prevalence appears less significant during colder months, suggesting that other factors may play a role or that a threshold temperature is necessary for increased incidence.\\n\\nThe higher incidence observed in autumn could indicate that summer's higher temperatures or increased reservoir prevalence affect fall prevalence. The biology of Campylobacter, which tolerates cold but is sensitive to light, supports this observation.\\n\\nHigh relative humidity and precipitation contribute to Campylobacter survival in the environment. While one study noted increased Campylobacter carriage in poultry during elevated temperature and high humidity, our study found that these factors were not significant predictors of broiler flock prevalence. This discrepancy may arise from national-level measurements that overlook regional variations. Assessing temperature and humidity within broiler houses may yield more accurate insights.\\n\\nComplex interactions among climatic factors complicate the elucidation of individual factor effects. Future research should focus on the broiler environment's elements susceptible to climate, the interaction of microclimatic factors, and the quantification of broilers' contribution to human Campylobacter infections.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nWe found a strong relationship between temperature and Campylobacter infections in both broilers and humans, with the most significant effects observed at maximum weekly temperatures above 13°C. The combined effect of temperature and sunlight hours, along with relative humidity, predicted human infection, while the role of these parameters in broiler flock prevalence was less clear. Further investigations into food consumption, preparation practices, and seasonal variations in poultry sales are warranted. Additionally, the impact of climatic factors on Campylobacter incidence in other countries should be explored.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1. Anonymous. 2000.

Due to high degree of seasonality and autocorrelation, seasonally adjusted (de-seasonalized) and trend adjusted data (de-trended) were used for comparing incidences within and between the six countries. De-seasonalized time series were obtained by fitting the incidence time series to mean monthly temperature and then removing this effect from the data. Long-term trends were fitted to the de-seasonalized time series. The incidence of Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and incidence of campylobacteriosis in humans showed a concordant seasonality for all the countries. There was a strong association between the incidence in both broilers and humans in a given month and the mean temperature of the northern hemisphere in the same month, as well as the preceding month, as shown by the cross-correlations and the chosen Generalized Additive Model. Denmark and Sweden showed a steadily decreasing trend for Campylobacter in broilers and human campylobacteriosis in the period 2001–2007. In Iceland, there was a decreasing trend for campylobacteriosis in humans from 1999 to 2007, whilst the broiler trend for Campylobacter was stable from 2001 to 2004, then falling thereafter. In Norway, the human campylobacteriosis trend showed a steady increase throughout the period. On the other hand, the Norwegian broiler trend for Campylobacter showed a decrease from 2001 until 2004, but was thereafter stable. There was no significant decrease or increase in incidence for human campylobacteriosis.\\n\\n* Corresponding author.

Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter are ubiquitous bacteria, frequently found in the alimentary tracts of animals, especially birds, and commonly contaminate the environment, including water. It is, however, less clear how the bacteria are distributed in the environment, and in what numbers. Since the 1970s, Campylobacter have been shown to be an important cause of enteritis in humans and regarded as the most common cause of reported bacterial gastroenteritis in the EU (Anonymous, 2007). Most Campylobacter infections occur as sporadic cases and consumption of undercooked broiler meat is regarded as a significant source of human infections (Reiersen et al., 2001; Vellinga and van Loock, 2002; Stern et al., 2003; Wingstrand et al., 2006; Anonymous, 2007). Possible sources of Campylobacter for broiler flocks are: low levels of biosecurity; presence of rodents on farms; age of broilers (Hansson et al., 2007; McDowell et al., 2008), drinking water that has not been disinfected (Kapperud et al., 1993); or other livestock on the farm/neighbourhood (van de Giessen et al., 1996; Bouwknegt et al., 2004). In the Netherlands, it has been estimated that 20–40% of all laboratory-confirmed cases are attributable to consumption of undercooked chicken. Nearly the same estimate (40%) was found in Belgium (Vellinga and van Loock, 2002; Janssen et al., 2008). Other identified sources are contaminated drinking water, raw milk and contact with pets (Kapperud et al., 2003; Ethelberg et al., 2005; Olson et al., 2008). Although these potential sources have been identified, the routes of transmission and their relative importance are still uncertain.\\n\\nIn wild birds and chickens, the Campylobacter carriage rate (the number of birds carrying the bacteria), and the numbers of Campylobacter in the small intestine and caeca of broilers, have a seasonal pattern, with a distinct peak in prevalence in summer and a low prevalence during winter (Jacobs-Reitsma et al., 1994; Wallace et al., 1997; Wedderkopp et al., 2001; Hansson et al., 2004; Hofshagen and Kruse, 2005; Olson et al., 2008). This seasonal fluctuation in Campylobacter numbers is reflected in the increased risk of human infection from carcass contamination and environmental sources at certain times of the year. Similar seasonal pattern of raised summer incidence is also seen in the occurrence of human campylobacteriosis in Northern Europe (Nylen et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2004; Meldrum et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2006; Heier et al., 2006; van Hees et al., 2007; Olson et al., 2008). Several studies suggest that climate may play a role in colonization of both animals and humans (Patrick et al., 2004; Kovats et al., 2005; Louis et al., 2005; Valérie et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2006; Fleury et al., 2006). Seasonal variation in infection pressure may be dependent on climatic variables like temperature, length and intensity of daylight and precipitation, as well as changes in host social behaviour and in host immune system (Altizer et al., 2006). Seasonal variation in the incidence of infectious diseases is a well-known phenomenon worldwide, although the mechanisms behind are poorly understood in many instances (Grassly and Fraser, 2006).\\n\\nOne possible explanation for the seasonality of human campylobacteriosis, besides a documented seasonal variation in several food sources, includes prevalence of Campylobacter in environmental reservoirs, which varies greatly with season (Jacobs-Reitsma et al., 1994; Stanley and Jones, 2003). The seasonal effectiveness of the human immune system response and the possible role acquired immunity plays, are also important factors in the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis (Mann et al., 2000; Skelly and Weinstein, 2003; Havelaar et al., 2009).'),\n",

The calculation of the annual/monthly incidence was based on date of slaughter, i.e. flock lifetime incidence. A slaughter group was regarded as positive if at least one of the cloacal or the caecal samples proved positive for Campylobacter. Details for each country are described in Table 1. The incidence data for campylobacteriosis in humans originated from the countries’ surveillance data. Information regarding age, gender, country of infection and place of residency were available for all the countries. Annual/monthly incidence for domestically infected cases was calculated based on the total population by the end of the year/beginning of next year.

Data Analysis\\n\\n# 2.2.1. Incidence Data\\n\\nMonthly incidences of domestic human campylobacteriosis and of Campylobacter-positive broiler flocks were investigated by descriptive and explorative methods. Due to strong seasonality of the data, the time series of monthly incidences were plotted against mean ambient temperature per month for the northern hemisphere.\\n\\nFinland’s surveillance data was only included in the presentation of annual incidences and not in the further analyses due to short time span of broiler data, i.e. from 2004 to 2007. Finland was still kept in the overall study because it adds information to the annual and monthly seasonal incidences.\\n\\n# 2.2.2.

However, the Danish and Norwegian time series showed remaining periodicity, with a notable 6-month periodicity found in the Norwegian data.\\n\\n# 4.

Annual incidences of domestic campylobacteriosis in humans in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands in the time period 1990–2007. (Available data for Denmark from 1991, the Netherlands from 1993 and Finland from 1995.)\\n\\nData sources are therefore different. This represents potential sources of bias in the study. The surveillance programs for broilers and humans in the six countries differ, and the sampling and laboratory methods used over time have varied during these years and between countries. These variations amongst the countries make the data not directly comparable, but still commensurable.\\n\\nEnteric disease surveillance in humans is known to underestimate incidence considerably, so the aggregated disease incidences are probably conservative estimates. This aspect would again differ between the six countries. Improvement in notification systems, changes in diagnostic techniques, and general public awareness of the disease may play a role and can therefore explain some of the increase in the incidence of campylobacteriosis seen from 1990 to 2007.\\n\\nThis study demonstrates that the incidence of Campylobacter colonization in broiler flocks and the incidence of campylobacteriosis in humans show a concordant seasonality for all the six countries. This is consistent with findings in other studies in Europe, suggesting that seasonal factors may play a role in infection. In contrast, no clear seasonal peak of campylobacteriosis has been detected in the tropics.\\n\\nFig. 5. Depiction of the cross-correlation between broiler and human time series incidences using the overall de-seasonalized mean incidence of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands.\\n\\nBroiler carcasses are easily contaminated by Campylobacter during the slaughter process, and thus especially contribute during the seasonal peaks to the incidence of campylobacteriosis in humans. Consequently, much effort is put into control strategies along the poultry meat production chain. Control strategies invented to reduce incidence of campylobacteriosis by reducing Campylobacter contamination on poultry meat have, however, only been partly successful.\\n\\nWild birds, sewage, and faecal shedding by cattle, pigs, and sheep can be sources of Campylobacter contaminating surface waters, streams, and agricultural run-off. Quantitative studies of surface waters show higher numbers of Campylobacter in winter than in summer. However, as Campylobacter may be viable, but not culturable, such data may be difficult to interpret. Campylobacter has a relatively low die-off rate in water and thus water may act as a reservoir for Campylobacter. Other factors which can contribute to the seasonal patterns seen in this study are human behaviour and lifestyle-determined exposure.\\n\\nReferences: Jones, 2001; Stanley and Jones, 2003; Newell and Fearnley, 2003; Hofshagen and Kruse, 2005; Johnsen et al., 2006; Nylen et al., 2002; Patrick et al., 2004; Kovats et al., 2005; Tam et al., 2006; Olson et al., 2008; Hartnack et al., 2009; Allos, 2001.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacteriosis Trends\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Trends for Campylobacteriosis in Humans and Broilers\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study examines the trends of campylobacteriosis in humans and its correlation with Campylobacter in broilers, focusing on the impact of temperature and seasonality.\\n\\n# Introduction'),\n",

This paper explores the trends in campylobacteriosis cases in humans and the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler populations over a specified time frame.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nFig. 6. Trends for campylobacteriosis in humans fitted to the de-seasonalized time series with confidence interval (black with grey hatched area), and trends for Campylobacter in broilers with confidence interval (black with black dotted lines). The time span for humans ranges from 1997 to 2007, and for broilers from 2001 to 2007.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe inherent seasonality of the human immune system may contribute to the observed seasonality in campylobacteriosis cases. Increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation can impair the immune response, coinciding with higher exposure to Campylobacter from various sources.\\n\\nTemperature was found to be highly correlated with the incidence of Campylobacter-positive broilers and campylobacteriosis in humans. The study identified that the mean ambient temperature for the sampling month and the preceding month had the highest correlation with the data.\\n\\nIn the Netherlands, a model using only the mean temperature for the month preceding the sampling month provided an even better fit for both human campylobacteriosis and broiler incidence data. This may be attributed to the warmer climate in the Netherlands, which influences the Campylobacter season.\\n\\nPrevious studies have also indicated a strong relationship between temperature and the incidence of human campylobacteriosis and Campylobacter-positive broiler flocks.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe findings of this study underscore the importance of monitoring environmental factors, particularly temperature, in understanding the trends of campylobacteriosis in humans and broiler populations.\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Campylobacter in Humans and Broilers\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Campylobacter in Humans and Broilers\\n\\nIn a study examining the incidence of human domestic campylobacteriosis and the presence of Campylobacter-positive broilers at slaughter across six European countries, distinct seasonal variations were observed. The research indicated that both human and broiler incidences exhibited similar seasonal patterns, which were influenced by temperature-related factors.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nPrevious studies have suggested that environmental factors, particularly temperature, play a significant role in the seasonal dynamics of Campylobacter. For instance, Jacobs-Reitsma et al. (1994) proposed that temperature indirectly affects the Campylobacter carriage state in animal reservoirs. Additionally, seasonal peaks in diarrheal disease incidence have been correlated with high densities of house flies, which are considered potential vectors for Campylobacter transmission (Chavasse et al., 1999; Hald et al., 2004).\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nThe study utilized monthly data to analyze the correlation between human and broiler incidences. It was noted that a more frequent sampling schedule could enhance the evaluation of this correlation. The findings align with previous research indicating the importance of broiler flocks in human infections (Pearson et al., 1993; Meldrum et al., 2005).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that the temperature during the sampling month and the preceding month significantly correlated with the incidence of Campylobacter-positive broiler flocks and human campylobacteriosis. However, the long-term trends varied among countries, suggesting that other factors, such as antigenic diversity and host immunity, may also influence these trends (Altizer et al., 2006).\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nIn Norway, for example, the steady increase in campylobacteriosis incidence despite stable Campylobacter-positive broiler flocks indicates that other sources, such as non-disinfected drinking water, may be more significant (Kapperud et al., 2003). This highlights the complexity of Campylobacter transmission dynamics and the need for further research to identify the drivers of seasonality.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe study concludes that understanding the seasonality of Campylobacter is crucial for developing effective control strategies. Future research should focus on identifying the environmental and biological factors that influence the incidence of campylobacteriosis and Campylobacter colonization in various reservoirs.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe would like to thank Anja Kristoffersen for her assistance with data analysis, Bruce David and Sonja Hartnack-Wilhelm for their critical reviews, and Ketil Isaksen for providing temperature data.

Between 2006 and 2012, 4702 fecal samples were taken from patients ≤5 years of age with acute gastroenteritis complaints; these samples were analysed in terms of rotavirus group A and adenovirus serotype 40–41 antigens.\\n\\nResults: Rotavirus antigens were found in 797 (17.0%) samples, adenovirus antigens in 113 samples (2.4%), and rotavirus and adenovirus antigens together in 16 samples (0.3%). There was shown to be a seasonal change in rotavirus gastroenteritis (p<0.001) and it was observed that the 1°C decrease in average temperature level increased the ratio of rotavirus cases in those with diarrhea by 0.523%. In addition, compared to data from other years, the number of patients was lower in the first month of 2008 and the second month of 2012, when weather temperatures were below -20°C. It was determined that there was no statistically significant relation between adenovirus infection and changes in weather conditions.\\n\\nConclusion: It was concluded that various factors like changes in weather conditions, as well as the population’s sensitivity and associated changes in activity played a role in the spread of rotavirus infection.\\n\\nKey words: adenovirus, children, gastroenteritis, rotavirus, weather conditions\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

A significant proportion of these cases are seen in developing countries.1\\n\\nRotaviruses are declared as the most frequent factor in children who receive consultation due to severe diarrhea.2,3 Every year, 610,000 children under the age of five die globally as a result of rotavirus gastroenteritis, and most of these deaths are seen in developing countries.4 In two new studies, enteric adenoviruses were reported as the second most frequent acute gastroenteritis factor after rotaviruses in children under the age of five.5,6 It was stated that adenoviruses were responsible for 5%-15% of gastroenteritis cases in newborns and preschool children, with the clinical course being easier in children whose immune systems were sufficient.7,8\\n\\nFecal-oral routes, droplet routes, and contaminated surfaces and foodstuffs have a role in the spread of rotavirus and adenovirus.7,9 Viral gastroenteritis is observed in both developed and developing countries with the same frequency; it arouses curiosity as to whether epidemiological factors may have a role in gastroenteritis outbreaks as do seasonal differences, and this possibility is currently being researched.2,10\\n\\nMany infectious diseases show seasonal characteristics, and periodical fluctuations are observed throughout the year.11 The change in a factor’s pathogenicity or virulence may lead to a change in seasonal characteristics year after year, and performing vaccinations may also dramatically change the seasonal fluctuation characteristics.11 Observational studies show that the frequency of rotavirus gastroenteritis in temperate climates changes seasonally and peaks typically in the winter and early spring. It is stated that frequency is seen more commonly in dry seasons, but the seasonal change is less obvious in tropical climates.2,4 Moreover, it has been shown that cases of adenovirus gastroenteritis are seen more often in winter months, with no studies researching the frequency of the seasonal change and adenovirus gastroenteritis.7,12\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Fecal samples from a total of 4702 outpatients (infected in the community) were analysed retrospectively from the laboratory records in terms of rotavirus group A and adenovirus serotype 40–41 antigens. Demographic patient data were evaluated. Repeating samples (within three months) belonging to the same patients were excluded from the study. The existence of rotavirus group A and adenovirus (serotype 40–41) antigens in stool samples was analysed according to immunochromatographic methods (ICT) and working procedures of the manufacturing firm using the VikiaRota-Adenokits (Biomérieux; Sensitivity of rotavirus 100% and adenovirus 97.6%, specificity 100%) between 2006 and 2008, and the ACON One Step Rotavirus and Adenovirus Combo Test Device (U.S.A.; Sensitivity 99.6%, specificity 99.4%) between 2008 and 2012.\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Monthly average temperature and minimum temperatures and average humidity data were created with daily data.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nTo determine the relationship between temperature and humidity ratios, the number of rotavirus (ROTAVIRUS) and adenovirus (ADENOVIRUS) cases, the average temperature level (AVETEMP), minimum temperature level (MINTEMP), proportion of rotavirus cases in total cases (PROTAVIRUS) and proportion of adenovirus cases in total cases (PADENOVIRUS), and humidity proportion (HUMIDITY) variables were used. Obtained data were evaluated using time-series analysis (unit root tests and regression analysis) and negative binomial regression analysis. Because of seasonality detection, seasonality was eliminated from the data. Then, it was determined whether each series was stationary by applying the unit root test. As the series were level stationary, the relationship between the variables was specified via regression analysis. Because an outlier was detected at this stage, the application was conducted with robust regression (s-estimator) analysis. For the condition in which the number of cases was considered a dependent variable, results were confirmed with negative binomial regression. Our study was carried out as per the conformity decision of the ethics committee of Cumhuriyet University.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nIn our study, fecal samples of 4702 patients were analyzed over a seven-year period between 2006 and 2012 in terms of rotavirus group A and adenovirus serotype 40–41; viral antigens were detected in 910 (19.3%) of 4702 patients. Of these antigens, 797 (17.0%) were detected as rotavirus and 113 (2.4%) as adenovirus. Rotavirus and adenovirus antigens were found together in 16 samples (0.3%).\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

It was seen that the age range of 0–2 years constituted the biggest group (3112 patients, 66.2%) when rotavirus and adenovirus frequency were obtained and evaluated during the study according to patient age ranges.\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\nFigure 1 shows that the number of rotavirus cases decreased in the period when the average temperature and minimum temperature were high, but increased in the period when the temperature was low. This indicates the existence of an inverse relationship between the two variables. Another interesting finding here is that the number of patients is lower than other years in the first month of 2008 and the second month of 2012, when the weather temperatures were below -20°C.\\n\\nWhen the ratio of rotavirus cases to total cases and the percentage of humidity is considered, it is clear that these two series act in parallel (same direction). The rotavirus patient ratio increases at high levels of humidity and decreases at low levels. A clear seasonal change is observed in Figure 2. A high number of rotavirus-based cases is seen in the months when the temperature is low and humidity ratio is high; this ratio decreases in the months when the humidity ratio is low.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\nThe ratio of the number of rotavirus cases to total number of events, and the monthly average levels of temperature and humidity are shown in Figure 2. Monthly averages not being at the same level (differing by month) is the sign of the data seasonality. Firstly, the data used in the analysis were seasonally adjusted by using the X13-ARIMA method because they showed seasonality, as seen in Figures 1 and 2. (X-13 ARIMA is a programme developed by U.S. Census Bureau in order to eliminate the seasonality occurred in data.) This eliminates the possibility for the relationship to be caused by seasonality between variables, with the aim to discern the genuine relationship between variables.\\n\\nThe relationship between variables is spurious if the variables are nonstationary. That is to say, the results achieved in regression analysis by using nonstationary variables are invalid. Therefore, it was determined...\\n\\nFigure 1: Rotavirus Cases vs Temperature\\n\\nFigure 2: Rotavirus Cases vs Humidity\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Specifically, a one-degree decrease in average temperature was associated with a 0.523% increase in the ratio of rotavirus cases to total diarrhea cases. No significant relationship was found between rotavirus cases and humidity ratio (p=0.973).\\n\\nAdditionally, the model included a one-period lagged value of the dependent variable [PROTAVIRUS(-1)] to assess delay effects. The results indicated a statistically significant relationship (p<0.001).\\n\\n# Temperature Effects\\n\\nTo further explore the impact of extreme temperatures, a dummy variable was introduced to the model, where D=1 for temperatures at -20°C and below, and D=0 for temperatures above -20°C. The findings showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.02), indicating that temperatures below -20°C decreased the ratio of rotavirus patients by 2.659% relative to total patients.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOverall, the regression model's R² statistics suggest that the model is generally robust in explaining the relationship between temperature and rotavirus cases.\\n\\n**Table 1: Stationarity Test Results**\\n|Test Statistic|Critical Value (1%)|Critical Value (5%)|Critical Value (10%)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|-3.45|-3.50|-2.89|-2.57|\\n\\nFigure 3: Influential Values in Regression Analysis\\n\\n**Table 2: Regression Analysis Results**\\n|Variable|Coefficient|p-value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Average Temperature|-0.523|<0.001|\\n|Humidity Ratio|0.001|0.973|\\n|Lagged Value of Rotavirus|0.456|<0.001|\\n|Dummy Variable (-20°C)|-2.659|0.02|\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Analysis of Rotavirus Cases\\n\\nSignificant autocorrelation function values and Q statistics of residuals obtained from the model are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 shows the eligibility of the regression model.\\n\\nIn order to prove the aforementioned results, a second analysis was implemented. As it is known, the relationship between variables is evaluated by regression analysis. However, in situations such as where data related to dependent variables are obtained by counting, the data are discrete, and various regression methods have been developed to be used in situations of this nature. One of these methods is the Poisson regression analysis. In this analysis, the Poisson regression model has been applied, but the average of the dependent variable is equal to its variance in the Poisson regression method. If this condition is not provided, it is called overdispersion, and it is the sign of a misappropriation of the Poisson regression model to the data.\\n\\nIn a model that treated the number of rotavirus cases as the dependent variable and the average temperature and humidity levels as the independent variables, overdispersion has been detected; because of this, the negative binomial regression method has been used.\\n\\n# Results of Negative Binomial Regression Analysis\\n\\nThe results of negative binomial regression analysis given in Table 3 show the existence of an inverse and statistically significant relationship between the number of rotavirus cases and average temperature level (p<0.001). No statistically significant relationship could be found between the humidity ratio and rotavirus cases (p=0.570). The statistical significance of the α parameter given in Table 3 shows the inadaptability of the Poisson regression model.\\n\\nThe number of cases in which adenovirus was found is quite limited. In the regression analysis, the adenovirus case ratio was calculated, and seasonality was eliminated from the series with the X13-ARIMA method, as the obtained ratio values had seasonal influence. The ADF unit root test was applied to the series, from which seasonality was eliminated. As a result of the test, it was found that the ratio of the number of adenovirus cases to the total...\\n\\nFigure 4: Autocorrelation Function Values and Q Statistics\\n\\n**Table 3: Results of Negative Binomial Regression Analysis**\\n|Variable|Coefficient|p-value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Average Temperature|-0.45|<0.001|\\n|Humidity Ratio|0.10|0.570|\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Gastroenteritis and Weather Conditions\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that the adenovirus number (PADENOVIRUS) was stationary (ADF: -7.35; p<0.001). The average temperature level and humidity ratio variables, which are the other variables to be used in the analysis, are also stationary (Table 1). As all the variables are level stationary, the relationship between these variables was examined with regression analysis. The model was estimated using the least squares method, as well as through the usage of the s-estimator from the robust regression method due to detected outliers. According to the results of the regression analysis seen in Table 4, it was found that there were no statistically significant relationships between the adenovirus ratio in all diarrhea cases and the average temperature level and humidity ratios.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nIn our study, the seasonal change in rotavirus gastroenteritis frequency was clearly shown. A limited seasonal difference was observed in adenovirus gastroenteritis; however, the seasonal difference could not be assessed due to the low case number. This finding shows similarity with data obtained from other temperate climates. When we analyzed the change in factors influencing the weather conditions and that of rotavirus and adenovirus gastroenteritis frequency, a significant inverse relation was found only in temperature change and rotavirus gastroenteritis frequency. It is predicted that the considerably low number of adenovirus gastroenteritis cases influenced the statistical analysis results towards non-determination of a similar change between the adenovirus frequency and temperature change.\\n\\nIt was found that a one-degree decrease in the average temperature level increased the ratio of rotavirus cases in diarrhea cases by 0.523%; an increase in the number of cases and a seasonal change between November and February were also observed. Rotavirus gastroenteritis cases can be seen throughout the year, with the number of cases especially increasing in winter months. It is under discussion that various factors may have a role in the increased number of cases seen in the winter months of temperate climates.\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Cold weather causes people to stay in closed areas more often in the winter months, and can lead to sensitive people coming into contact with contaminated surfaces, objects, and people at a higher frequency and intensity.\\n\\nLikewise, it is known that respiratory tract infections spread by contact, droplets, and respiration, in addition to those caused by respiratory tract viruses, are seen more frequently in winter months when people are in closed areas and under more crowded living circumstances. Besides, low temperatures can cause the virus to stay alive for a longer time in environmental conditions when the infection is carried to open areas, and this situation increases the spread of these viruses into large areas. In support of these findings, the number of cases is lower compared to similar two month periods when temperature changes are below -20°C as stated in our results. Temperature changes that are too low can restrict a person’s outdoor activities, causing the viral spread to stay in smaller areas and preventing larger environmental exposure. Rotavirus shows its highest activity at around 9°C, and we think that temperature levels that are very low, like -20°C, will negatively affect the survival of the virus under environmental circumstances.\\n\\nAnother hypothesis related to the fact that people are exposed to viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections more often in winter months is the change in general immunity. Ultraviolet light enables synthesis of vitamin D in the skin, which has immunomodulatory and immunostimulatory effects. As people are not sufficiently exposed to ultraviolet light in winter months, vitamin D insufficiency may arise, leading to a tendency for developing certain infections.\\n\\nIt has been found that the seasonal changes in relative humidity have different effects on the frequency of rotavirus gastroenteritis. A linear inverse relationship was found.\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Previous studies in Spain, Great Britain, and the Netherlands found no significant relations between humidity and rotavirus infection.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn our study, we observed an increase in the number of rotavirus patients at high humidity levels. However, regression analyses did not reveal a significant relationship between rotavirus frequency and humidity changes, consistent with other European studies. We hypothesize that relative humidity does not influence rotavirus infection in temperate climates but does have an impact in sub-tropical and tropical climates.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nWe presented a model researching the relationship between changes in weather conditions and the frequency of rotavirus and adenovirus gastroenteritis. The analysis was based on rotavirus and adenovirus ratios in all diarrhea cases among subjects aged five years and younger who visited a third-degree health establishment.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nOur findings indicated a strong inverse relationship between clear seasonal changes, temperature fluctuations, and the frequency of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases. However, attributing the increase in cases during cold winter months solely to weather changes would be an oversimplification. Various factors, including individual sensitivity, changes in activities, and environmental conditions, contribute to the spread of rotavirus infection.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nFurther studies are necessary to explore the effects of changing weather conditions on human behavior and their direct effects on the virus.\\n\\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Data on weather variables, notified cryptosporidiosis cases and population size in Brisbane were supplied by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Queensland Department of Health, and Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Both time series ZIP and CART models show a clear association between weather variables (maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed) and cryptosporidiosis disease. The time series CART models indicated that, when weekly maximum temperature exceeded 31°C and relative humidity was less than 63%, the relative risk of cryptosporidiosis rose by 13.64 (expected morbidity: 39.4; 95% confidence interval: 30.9–47.9). These findings may have applications as a decision support tool in planning disease control and risk-management programs for cryptosporidiosis disease.\\n\\nKeywords: Cryptosporidiosis, CART, Time series, Weather, ZIP\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nInfectious diseases are sensitive to climate variability because temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed can influence the development and transmissibility of pathogens, and can also affect people’s behaviour. Climate change is very likely to increase the risk of certain health outcomes, including natural disaster-related deaths such as floods, bushfires and cyclones, vector-borne diseases, and particularly water-borne diseases including a number of diarrheal diseases (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007; McMichael et al. 1996).\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis is a common diarrheal disease of humans. It is caused by a microscopic single-celled parasite, *Cryptosporidium parvum*, that can stay alive in the intestines of humans, farm animals, wild animals, and pets (Rose et al. 2002). The illness is usually self-limiting and lasts only a few days. Although the most common symptom is diarrhea, which is usually watery and may be profuse, people with weakened immune systems may develop severe and long-lasting illness, which may contribute to death. This illness appears to be more common in warmer months. Cryptosporidiosis is one of the common infectious diseases in Australia and globally (Meinhardt et al. 1996). The individual risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in humans include drinking water from poorly treated public and private supplies, swimming in pools, contact with farm animals and institutionalisation.\\n---\\n# Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Variables\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Cryptosporidiosis and Climate Variables: A Study in Brisbane, Australia\\n\\nIn the period from 1996 to 2004, a total of 5,744 laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis cases were identified in the state of Queensland, Australia (Australian Department of Health and Aged Care 2004). From a public health perspective, there is a need to control and prevent this widespread disease. To achieve this, it is essential to better understand the relationships between the disease and relevant, accessible, and timely risk factors such as climate variables in epidemic-prone regions. This motivates the development of statistical models to describe and predict cryptosporidiosis disease using climate variables.\\n\\nOur previous study assessed the relationship between monthly weather variability and the monthly counts of cryptosporidiosis (Hu et al. 2007). However, two issues remain to be resolved. First, time-aggregation leads to larger standard errors when the frequency decreases, as it reduces sample size and introduces measurement errors (Jacobsen and Dannenburg 2003; Petersen and Koput 1992). Furthermore, monthly aggregation data may be too coarse to fully establish predictive capability in the models. Second, it will be helpful to examine whether different modelling approaches based on weekly data will have any impact on overall findings.\\n\\nThe time series Poisson regression model has been used extensively for the analysis of count data (Zeger 1988). Count data often have a higher incidence of zero counts than expected for the Poisson distribution (Afifi et al. 2007; Cheung 2002). In this case, the use of the conventionally employed Poisson regression may result in a poorly fitted model. An alternative approach for analysing count data with many zeros is to use a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model that assumes that the population consists of two subgroups of individuals (Afifi et al. 2007; Cheung 2002). In the case of cryptosporidiosis, these subgroups might be classified as those who are unaffected and those who are potentially affected by the disease. However, although the ZIP is more general than the standard Poisson distribution, it remains rather inflexible in terms of satisfying linearity constraints and distributional assumptions (Afifi et al. 2007; Ridout et al. 2001). Time series classification and regression tree (CART) models provide an alternative non-parametric approach that can better describe complex interactions since they avoid any assumption of linear relationships among the variables or homoscedasticity in variances (Breiman et al. 1984).\\n\\n# Aims of the Study\\n\\nThe aims of this paper are three-fold:\\n\\n1. To examine the potential impact of weekly weather variability on the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in an epidemic-prone city, Brisbane, Australia—the capital of Queensland.\\n2. To explore the interactive relationship between different weather variables on the incidence of cryptosporidiosis.\\n3. To provide an illustration and comparison of two time-series models of a health effect, based on data comprising many zeros.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Study Area\\n\\nBrisbane, a subtropical city of Queensland, is situated on the southeast corner of Queensland, Australia at latitude 27°28′S, longitude 153°02′E and covers approximately 1,326 km2. The population size was 883,449 on 30 June 2001 (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2002). Brisbane has a subtropical climate with hot, moist summers and mild, dry winters. In this study, Brisbane was chosen as the main research site because it had the highest proportion of cases (23.4%) of cryptosporidiosis during 1996–2004 in the state.\\n\\n# Data Collection\\n\\nWe obtained computerized data on notified cryptosporidiosis cases (based on laboratory confirmations) in Brisbane for the period 1 January 1996–31 December 2004 from the Queensland Department of Health. Climate and population data were obtained for the same period from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Weather data comprised weekly mean maximum temperature (°C), mean relative humidity (%), total precipitation (mm), and wind speed (km/h). As discussed in the Introduction, other factors may be directly or indirectly related to cryptosporidiosis outbreaks. However, as this is an ecological study, the data on risk factors at the individual level (e.g., outbreak from contact with animals and swimming in pools) were unavailable.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\n# Cross-Correlation Function\\n\\nCross-correlations were used to assess the linear associations between weekly weather variables and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis over a range of time lags. A time lag was defined as the time span between climatic observation and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis (Chatfield 1975).\\n\\n# ZIP Model'),\n",

ZIP models were used to describe count data for which the proportion of zero counts is greater than expected on the basis of the distribution of the non-zero counts (Lambert 1992). ZIP models are two-component mixture models that combine a point mass at zero with a proper count distribution. Zeros may come from both the point mass.\\n\\nReferences: Australian Bureau of Statistics (2002), Australian Department of Health and Aged Care (2004), Afifi et al. (2007), Cheung (2002), Hu et al.

When maximum temperature exceeded 31°C and relative humidity was under 63%, the RR of cryptosporidiosis rose to 13.64 (expected morbidity: 39.4; 95% CI: 30.9–47.9). When maximum temperature exceeded 31°C, relative humidity was over 63% and rainfall was under 4 mm, the RR of cryptosporidiosis rose to 6.49 (expected morbidity: 18.7; 95% CI: 10.3–27.07). The best tree, based on cross-validated minimum deviance, had four terminal nodes. Although the CART model did not explicitly include an auto-correlation term, this was described by the covariates, which are by nature similarly autocorrelated, as indicated by the lack of residuals after accounting for these variables.\\n\\n# Goodness-of-fit of Models\\n\\nFigure 5 shows the plot of the cumulative sums of actual and predicted values for the ZIP model. The validation analyses indicate that the model had reasonable accuracy over the predictive period (RMSE: 3.23). The residual analyses indicated that there remained little substantive auto-correlation (auto-correlation coefficients less than 0.25). The graphical analysis shows that the residuals in the model appeared to fluctuate randomly around zero with no obvious trend in variation as the predicted incidence values increased. Overall, the model fitted the data well as the residuals appeared to be distributed randomly with relatively small variance.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe results of this study suggest that weather variability can be used to describe the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Brisbane. The key determinants of the cryptosporidiosis occurrences observed in this analysis included maximum weekly temperature at a moving average of lags of 0–8 weeks, relative humidity at a moving average of lag of 0–1 week, rainfall at a moving average of lag of 0–1 week, and wind speed at lag of 4 weeks. When maximum temperature exceeded 31°C and relative humidity was less than 63%, the RR of cryptosporidiosis rose by 13.64.\\n\\nOur previous study showed that the key determinants of observed monthly cryptosporidiosis incidence included maximum temperature and relative humidity (Hu et al. 2007). However, in the present study, both ZIP and CART models based on weekly data suggest that, in addition to these variables, rainfall and wind speed had a significant inverse association with cryptosporidiosis incidence. Theoretical results suggest that the short-term forecasting obtained from less aggregated series are more efficient if there are sufficient data, or if more sophisticated models are used to accommodate smaller counts (Jacobsen and Dannenburg 2003; Petersen and Koput 1992). The CART model developed in the present paper shows that the weekly cryptosporidiosis incidence was best described by an interaction between maximum temperature and relative humidity. The model indicates that cryptosporidiosis incidence is likely to increase in conditions above 31°C temperature and below 63% relative humidity. However, when relative humidity is above 63%, this interaction disappears and there appears to be little effect on cryptosporidiosis disease. The combination of the CART model and the ZIP model thus provide a more informative, comprehensive way to analyse these types of data.\\n\\nThe limitations of this study should also be acknowledged. Firstly, cryptosporidiosis disease is influenced not only by weather, but also by many other socio-biological factors (Rose et al. 2002). However, like the individual risk factor variables, data on those variables were not available. Secondly, the study focussed on only one city—Brisbane in Australia. The results must be interpreted with caution as the situation in other areas may vary. Thirdly, underreporting is likely to occur when people infected by cryptosporidiosis are asymptomatic and people who have clinical symptoms do not seek a doctor.'),\n",

Thirdly, underreporting is likely to occur when people infected by cryptosporidiosis are asymptomatic and people who have clinical symptoms do not seek a doctor.\\n\\nThe development of epidemic early warning systems is important in the control and prevention of epidemic diseases outbreaks. This study has identified relationships between weekly weather factors and cryptosporidiosis incidence and developed corresponding models that may be used for short-term forecasting and improvement of scenario-based predictive analysis. The findings of this study may assist local authorities to utilise these models to determine public health priorities, identify the communities that require particular attention, and mobilise scarce resources to effectively control and prevent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis during epidemic seasons. These findings may have applications as a decision support tool in planning disease control and risk-management programs for cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nAfifi A, Kotlerman J, Ettner S, Cowan M (2007) Methods for improving regression analysis for skewed continuous or counted responses.

Outcome data were supplemented with monthly aggregated ambient temperature and precipitation for each study location. We applied a linear mixed-effect model to relate the monthly normalized cryptosporidiosis incidence with normalized location-specific temperature and precipitation data.

In moist tropical locations, precipitation is a strong seasonal driver for cryptosporidiosis whereas temperature is in mid-latitude and temperate climates. When assessing lagged relationships, temperature and precipitation remain strong predictors. In Sub-Saharan Africa, after adjusting for distance from the equator, low NDVI values are predictive of an increase in cryptosporidiosis in the following month.\\n\\nDiscussion: In this study we propose novel methodology to assess relationships between disease outcomes and meteorological data on a global scale. Our findings demonstrate that while climatic conditions typically define a pathogen habitat area, meteorological factors affect timing and intensity of seasonal outbreaks. Therefore, meteorological forecasts can be utilized to develop focused prevention programs for waterborne cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nThe World Bank recently stated that worldwide 4 billion people live without adequate wastewater disposal and 2.4 billion live without proper sanitation. Given these conditions, diarrhea accounts for 4% of all deaths worldwide (WHO, 2008). A substantial fraction of diarrheal illnesses in developing and developed countries is caused by protozoa such as Cryptosporidium. Cryptosporidium is transmitted through water contaminated with human or livestock feces (Hunter and Thompson, 2005; Clark, 1999) or via human to human transmission (Dillingham et al., 2002; Griffiths, 1998). Currently, there are approximately 14 recognized species of Cryptosporidium of which two affect humans the most, C. hominis and C. parvum (Sopwith et al., 2005). Though cryptosporidiosis infection (CPI), infection due to the parasite Cryptosporidium, is self-limiting in immunocompetent people, it can prove to be life threatening to immuno-compromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS and the malnourished (Hawker et al., 2000; Griffiths, 1998). Children are the most susceptible to CPI and those less than 5 years of age have been shown to have the highest prevalence (Griffiths, 1998; Lima and Guerrant, 1992). Prevalence rates are higher in developing countries, 0.5–10%, compared to those in developed countries, 0.1–2% (Griffiths, 1998). CPIs in young children in developing countries lead to failure to thrive, severe persistent diarrhea, and increased mortality (Agnew et al., 1998; Checkley et al., 1997; Molbak et al., 1993).\\n\\nCPI typically manifests itself through a low endemic level and well-pronounced seasonal outbursts, indicating a strong effect of meteorological and environmental factors. Studies conducted in tropical climates note an increase in incidence during warm, rainy season (Perch et al., 2001; Newman et al., 1999; Adegbola et al., 1994) and studies conducted in temperate climates note increases.\\n\\n© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Jagai et al. / Environmental Research 109 (2009) 465–478\\n\\nin the spring and fall (Naumova et al., 2000, 2005; Shepherd et al.,\\n1988).     Our    recent     study     demonstrated          that    in   the    temperate\\nclimate of Massachusetts, CPI peaks about 6 weeks after ambient\\ntemperature reached its annual maxima (Naumova et al., 2007).\\nThere is strong evidence that the concentration of                       Cryptosporidium\\noocysts increases in drinking water and surface water sources after\\nheavy rainfall due to runoff (Muchiri et al., 2009; Lake et al., 2005;\\nAlterholt et al., 1998; LeChevallier et al., 1991). However, variation\\nin the rates of CPI cannot be explained by source of drinking water\\nalone     (Hughes       et    al.,  2004).      Recreational        facilities,    such     as\\nswimming pools, which are often used in the warmer months of\\nthe year, have also been associated with outbreaks of CPI (Dziuban\\net al., 2006; Craun et al., 2005; Yoder et al., 2004; Kramer et al.,\\n1998). Based on this evidence, temperature and precipitation need\\nto be assessed as drivers of seasonal patterns of CPI.\\n    It has been shown that long-term climate change can affect\\n\\nseasonal patterns of infectious diseases by lengthening the transmis-\\nsion cycle and changing thresholds, which determine seasonal peaks\\n(Harvell et al., 2002). Therefore, understanding the seasonality of a\\ndisease and its variation from year to year is the first step in\\nunderstanding the impact of long-term climate change on disease\\npatterns (Pascual et al., 2002). It is important to understand the\\n\\nenvironmental factors that underlie seasonal trends in order to\\nproperly predict long-term effects due to climate change. Assess-\\nment of long-term effects, especially on a large spatial scale, is often\\nlimited by availability of data, for both exposure and outcome. Data\\nacquired from remote sensing satellites can be advantageous for\\nassessment of         environmental          exposures, as        worldwide data           for\\nvarious time periods are readily accessible and provide a variety of\\n\\ninformation       such     as   temperature,        precipitation,       vegetation,      and\\nchemical content in the atmosphere.

For example, land surface temperature indices\\nhave been used to assess health impacts of urbanization (Kalnay\\nand Cai, 2003), spectral vegetation indices have been used to\\ndetermine the impact of floods due to deforestation (Cockburn\\net al., 1999), and sea surface temperature and height have been\\nused to explain the seasonal pattern of cholera outbreaks (Lobitz\\n\\net al., 2000). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\\nis the most often applied for use in epidemiology (Cringoli et al.,\\n2005) and has been shown to have predictive properties in studies\\non    onchocerciasis         in    Ethiopia      (Gebre-Michael           et    al.,  2005),\\nschistosomiasis in Brazil (Bavia et al., 2005), and West Nile virus\\n\\nin New York City (Brownstein et al., 2002). NDVI is a measure of\\ndensity of plant growth over the entire globe, which is calculated\\nfrom satellite image data. Very low values of NDVI (0.1 and below)\\ncorrespond to barren areas of rock, sand, or snow. Moderate values\\n\\nrepresent       shrub      and    grassland        (0.2–0.3),      while     high     values\\nindicate     temperate        and    tropical rainforests           (0.6–0.8).     NDVI      is\\nused as a proxy for both temperature and precipitation, as neither\\nmeasure alone sufficiently captures seasonal changes in weather.\\n    While seasonality of cryptosporidiosis is well described, the\\n\\nconsistency of such behavior on a global scale has not been\\ninvestigated in part due to limited data on the monthly incidence\\nof CPI collected over a long time period and difficulty in assessing\\nlocal information on meteorological parameters in remote areas.\\nIn this study, we assembled a set of time series representing\\n\\nmonthly incidence of CPI from 61 studies conducted in locations\\nworldwide         and    examined        the    relationships        between       CPI    and\\nmeteorological factors, namely precipitation and ambient tem-\\nperature. We also conducted a sub-analysis in studies conducted\\nin Sub-Saharan Africa in which we evaluated the use of the NDVI\\nfor    predicting       seasonal       increases       in    CPI.    We     developed         a\\nmeta-analysis framework to assess the link between proxies for\\nenvironmental exposure to protozoa via drinking and recreational\\nwater and CPI incidence, which includes normalization for the\\noutcome         and     exposure        variables,      a    mixed-effect         modeling\\nprocedure adapted to time series data, and visualization of joint\\neffects of environmental proxies on health outcome.\\n\\n2.   Methods and materials\\n\\n2.1.  Outcome data\\n\\n     We conducted a meta-analysis of studies published on CPI from 1966 to May\\n2008. Literature was gathered using the OVIDMedline search engine. The keywords\\nused in the search were cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium parvum or Cryptospor-\\nidium. These keywords were combined with seasonality               and seasons, resulting in\\n173 citations. The disease keywords were also combined with keywords for various\\ngeographic areas, such as West Africa, East Africa, Africa, Caribbean, and North America,\\nresulting in a total of 1923 citations. All of the search results were imported into\\nEndNote and duplicates were removed, resulting in a total of 1301 studies in the\\ndatabase. Studies were evaluated based on the following three criteria:\\n\\n(1)  studies must involve observational data on cryptosporidium in humans that\\n     are not immuno-compromised (i.e., HIV/AIDS patients);\\n(2)  studies must include at least a full year of data to cover all seasons;\\n(3)  studies must provide data on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.\\n\\n   Studies that did not meet the criteria were excluded. Fig. 1 demonstrates how\\nthe studies were classified and reasons for exclusion. A total of 138 studies met the\\nstudy criteria of which 49 studies presented data in the published journal article.\\nWe contacted authors of 82 studies, since 7 studies were duplicates, and 12 were\\nable to provide data in the requested format. CPI outcome data were collected from\\na total of 61 sites and were aggregated on a monthly basis. In cases where data\\nwere presented on a quarterly basis (5 studies) the outcome was equally divided\\nover the months in the quarter. The selected studies were conducted in different\\npopulations. Of the 61 studies, 24 (39.3%) studies were conducted in children less\\nthan 5 years of age, 16 studies (26.2%) were conducted in children less than\\n15 years of age, 20 (32.8%) studies were conducted in the general population, and\\n1 (1.6%) study was conducted in the elderly.

Exposure data\\n\\n     Based on each study site’s longitude and latitude, we supplemented monthly\\nrelative prevalence data with time-specific ambient temperature and precipitation,\\nobtained    from   the   National    Climatic   Data   Center   databases     (1080   of  1728\\nobservations ¼ 62.5%). When time-specific data were unavailable, temperature\\nand precipitation averages were used from Global Historical Climatology Network\\n(648 of 1728 observations ¼ 37.5%). Each study site was classified based on the\\nKo¨ ppen Climate Classification with a total of 30 categories. Using the study sites’\\nlatitude and longitude information each study location was plotted on a map of\\nKo¨ ppen Climate Classification and using a GIS spatial overlay each location was\\nclassified into a specific climate category. For the purposes of analysis we used only\\nthe four major classifications; moist tropical climates are classified as Climate A, arid\\nand semiarid climates are classified as Climate B, humid mid-latitude areas are\\nclassified as Climate C and colder temperate areas are classified as Climate D. Fig. 2\\nprovides a map of study locations and the number of years for which data were\\navailable for analysis.\\n     The studies selected for this analysis used different measures for cryptospor-\\nidiosis outcome. Of the 61 studies, 38 studies (62.3%) present outcome data as\\nnumber of cases, 14 studies (23.0%) present outcome as percent positive stools,\\n8 studies (13.1%) present outcome as prevalence, and one study (1.6%) presented the\\noutcome as incidence. In order to standardize the different outcome measures used\\nin each study the raw values were normalized into z-scores on a study-by-study\\nbasis. Monthly z-scores were also calculated for temperature and precipitation data\\nin order to assess relative associations. For example, a rainy month in a tropical\\nlocation such as Bangladesh will have different implications compared to a rainy\\nmonth in a dry arid location such as Kuwait. The          z-score was calculated using the\\nmean and standard deviation for the complete duration of each study as follows:\\nZ ij ¼x ij  ¯xi\\n         s i\\nwhere Zij is the z-score for xij, the actual value for outcome (CPI cases, prevalence,\\nor percent positive stools) or exposure (temperature, precipitation) for study i in\\nmonth j    and   x¯ i and si are the mean and standard deviation for each study,\\nrespectively.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Environmental Research\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\n.flow-chart {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 10px;\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper: Environmental Research\\n\\n# Literature Search Results\\n\\nTotal Studies Identified: N = 1301\\n\\nExcluded Studies:\\n\\n- No cryptosporidiosis (N = 101)\\n- Review studies (N = 47)\\n- News, letter to editor, opinion (N = 49)\\n- Studies on water quality (N = 105)\\n- Animal based studies (N = 115)\\n- Studies on biology, immunology (N = 163)\\n- Outbreak and surveillance studies (N = 160)\\n- Studies on HIV/AIDS patients (N = 212)\\n- Not a complete year of study (N = 211)\\n\\nStudies which met criteria: N = 138\\n\\nStudies without data: N = 89\\n\\nStudies with data: N = 49\\n\\nDuplicate studies: N = 7\\n\\nWrote letters: N = 82\\n\\nNo data: N = 70\\n\\nReceived data: N = 12\\n\\nTotal studies included in analysis: N = 61\\n\\n# Overall Analysis: Temperature, Precipitation, and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nWe examined seasonal patterns in temperature, precipitation, and cryptosporidiosis by climate category. We investigated relationships between temperature, precipitation, and CPI in each climate category using 2-D imaging with linear interpolation on the 3 neighboring data points, since the distributions of the predictor variables, z-score for temperature and precipitation, are essentially normal.\\n\\nA linear mixed-effect model was used to link the z-score of monthly CPI values with z-score of temperature and z-score of precipitation individually (Model 1). We examined the relationships overall for all the study sites as well as for each climate category. The mixed-effect regression model was defined as follows:\\n\\nZij = b0 + b1xij + b0i + b1ixij\\n\\nwhere Zij is the cryptosporidiosis z-score and xij the exposure of interest (temperature z-score or precipitation z-score) for month j in study i, the fixed effects: b0 is the population intercept and b1 the population slope, and random effects: b0 is the study intercept and b1 the study slope. The mixed-effect models were also examined utilizing the lagged exposure values to assess whether increased CPI rates may be due to temperature and precipitation exposure from the previous month (Model 2).\\n\\nThe regression models were also run adjusting for latitude or distance of the study site from the equator. We included the square of the study site’s latitude and the interaction with the exposure in the regression model as a fixed effect for each individual exposure predictor to control for the site’s distance from the equator (Model 3). By adjusting for the distance from the equator we can account, in part, for heterogeneity in the interaction between annual temperature and precipitation levels and overall climate characteristics. For example, in temperate climates the highest precipitation occurs in the warmer months whereas in tropical climates the highest precipitation occurs in the relatively cooler months. The mixed-effect model adjusting for the site distance from the equator was also run utilizing lagged exposure values (Model 4).\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Table 1\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #dddddd;\\ntext-align: left;\\npadding: 8px;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Table 1\\n\\nLocation, climate category, subject age, latitude, longitude and period of data for studies used in analysis.'),\n",

Sub-analysis: NDVI and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nA sub-analysis was conducted to assess the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a predictor for seasonal CPI increases. NDVI data were collected for 13 of the 14 studies conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa; NDVI data were not collected for 1 study because the study did not provide detail on the years in which the data were collected and the authors did not respond to requests for this information. NDVI data were obtained from the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) Africa Data Dissemination Service (FEWS Network, 2008).\\n\\nThe FEWS-NET NDVI data are a product from NASA’s Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) group, which provides 8 km resolution NDVI for every 10 days (Tucker et al., 2005; Pinzon et al., 2004). We used ESRI’s ArcMap 9.1 software and Python scripts to extract NDVI statistics for each city’s study area. A study area was defined by determining the bounding coordinates for the study location using the aerial imagery within Google Earth. The study area should avoid large water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans since these can skew NDVI measurements.\\n\\nThe NDVI data were imported into ArcMap and the raw pixel data values were divided by 250 to recover the NDVI range of 1 to 1. ArcToolbox’s Zonal Statistics function was used to calculate summary statistics for the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of all the NDVI pixel values within each defined study area. These summary statistics were then aggregated on a monthly basis.\\n\\nThe studies conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa fell into two climate categories, Climate A, moist tropical climates, and Climate C, humid mid-latitude areas. We examined the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and NDVI for all studies using the 2-D imaging linear interpolation method. The same four linear mixed-effect models were used to link the z-score of monthly CPI values with NDVI. We examined the relationship synchronized (Model 1), with lagged NDVI (Model 2), adjusting for distance of the study site from the equator (Model 3), and adjusting for the sites’ distance from the equator and utilizing lagged NDVI (Model 4).\\n\\n# 3. Results\\n\\n# 3.1. Overall Analysis: Temperature, Precipitation, and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nInitial descriptive analysis illustrates the average values of temperature and precipitation for all study sites and also for each climate subcategory (Table 2). All study sites provide 1722 months of data; on average, each study site had 28 months of data. Studies located in the moist tropical climate zone (Climate A) have the highest average monthly mean temperature with low variability and the highest monthly mean precipitation with the most variability. The arid/semiarid (Climate B) has the lowest rainfall of all climate categories. The mid-latitude climate (Climate C) and cold temperate climate (Climate D) have similarly temperate temperatures; however, Climate C is less variable.\\n\\nVisual analysis of seasonal patterns of temperature, precipitation, and CPI demonstrates differences by climate category (Figs. 3–6). Panels A–C in each figure show the temperature, precipitation, and cryptosporidiosis z-score for each study over a year. Panel D shows the relationship of CPI z-score to temperature and precipitation z-score for all studies in that climate group. In the moist tropical climate zone (A), temperature demonstrates subtle seasonality and precipitation peaks biannually. In this climate zone, CPI has high variability though it demonstrates a strong relationship with both temperature and the first peak in precipitation (Fig. 3).\\n\\nThe arid/semiarid region (Climate B) exhibits strong seasonality in temperature; however, there is no seasonality seen in precipitation or CPI (Fig. 4). Due to the fact that one study in this climate zone is from the southern hemisphere, we see a 6-month shift in the seasonal pattern of temperature for that study. In the mid-latitude climate (Climate C), temperature demonstrates a clear seasonality. Again, as in the arid/semiarid climate zone, precipitation does not exhibit a seasonal pattern; however, there is a slight peak in CPI in the spring (Fig. 5). The patterns for temperature and precipitation in the cold temperate climate (Climate D) mimic those seen in the humid mid-latitude climate (Climate C). However, CPI demonstrates a slight seasonal peak in the fall, which is associated with relatively higher precipitation (Fig. 6).\\n\\nThe results of the regression models for the individual exposure variables and lagged exposure variables are shown in Table 2.

Sub-analysis: NDVI and cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nFor studies conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa we conducted a sub-analysis utilizing NDVI data. Initial descriptive analysis illustrates the average values of NDVI for study sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and also by climate subcategory. The 13 studies conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa provided 302 months of data; on average each study site had 23 months of data. These studies were only in the moist tropical and humid mid-latitude climates and the average NDVI values were about equal in both climate categories.\\n\\nHigher NDVI values are associated with higher precipitation. When assessing synchronized (Model 1) and lagged (Model 2) relationships, overall NDVI, for all studies, was not significant. NDVI was a significant predictor of cryptosporidiosis z-score only in the humid mid-latitude climate (C). When assessing lagged (Model 2) relationships NDVI was significant in both the moist tropical (Climate A) and the humid mid-latitude (Climate C) areas.\\n\\n# 4.

There are two species of Cryptosporidium that most affect humans, C. hominis and C. parvum. The host reservoir for C. hominis is humans, while the host reservoirs for C. parvum are cattle, livestock, and humans. Studies have reported differing geographical ranges for the two species, and findings regarding differences between the species are fairly recent.\\n\\nIn this study, we adapted the Köppen Climate Classification for public health data by using only the four primary categories. This classification scheme is based on 30 years of data and is extremely complex. Therefore, utilizing these broad primary categories may cause grouping of different types of data.\\n\\nThe suggested approach of normalization of the outcome and exposure variables offers clear advantages for the analysis of CPI. By using the z-score, we gain compatibility between the data types, which is crucial in merging data from several sources; however, there is a loss of data specificity.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Environmental Research\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental Research\\n\\n# Seasonal Data Analysis on Cryptosporidium Infection\\n\\nThe primary limitation of this analysis is a small number of published studies that present seasonal data on CPI.

This had several repercussions in the study overall. Due to the small number of studies, we were not able to stratify the analysis by age. Again, due to the small number of available studies, the studies covered a large time span (1982–2006) and it was difficult to gather time-specific temperature and precipitation data for each study. For the studies in which averages were used, temperature and precipitation may not represent the weather specific to the year for which CPI data are available.\\n\\nThis study also demonstrated the utilization of NDVI as a proxy for environmental exposure to the protozoa Cryptosporidium. Preliminary analysis demonstrated that the various data sources for NDVI may not be comparable (Jagai et al., 2007). We used the FEWS-NET NDVI because it has been calibrated to take into account several issues, including volcanic ash from an eruption in S. Africa in 1991, intra-sensor degradation, and inter-sensor degradation (FEWS Network, 2008). The FEWS-NET data are also spatially and temporally smoothed to remove clouds and subpixel cloud contamination and are inter-calibrated with another high-resolution satellite that has a landcover sensor on board. Therefore, we found these data to be the most reliable for use in this sub-analysis. Our data set included only 13 studies in Africa for which NDVI data were extracted. A larger sample would have provided more data in each of the climate sub-categories to understand more clearly the differences by category. Since NDVI was strongly associated with precipitation of a study location, we believe that remote sensing data and indices reflecting vegetation water content in particular can be very useful for predicting the incidence of waterborne infections on a large geographical scale.\\n\\nContinued interest in the use of remote sensing for public health research (Patz, 2005) may lead to the development of new products that supersede NDVI and may be more appropriate for this type of analysis. Further research must be conducted to understand how NDVI and other remote sensing data can be used for all locations worldwide in a comparable manner and to examine the validity and comparability from different sources, various satellites, and over time. Remote sensing data, such as NDVI, can be beneficial as an early warning system to predict higher rates of waterborne diseases in particular areas.\\n\\nIn this study, as an extension of previous research (Naumova et al., 2007), we proposed novel methodology to capitalize on previously published data to assess the relationships between meteorological characteristics and disease outcomes. The methodology utilized in this study can be applied to a variety of waterborne diseases and infections caused by thermo-sensitive pathogens. Our study confirms previous studies, which demonstrate an increase in CPI during warm and rainy seasons (Perch et al., 2001; Newman et al., 1999; Adegbola et al., 1994). Temperature and precipitation are significant predictors of incidence of cryptosporidiosis, particularly in the tropical climates. Given the climate change predictions of increases in temperature and variability in precipitation (Patz et al., 2000) it is necessary to understand how these meteorological characteristics drive the seasonal patterns of disease. The meteorological characteristics can then be used to focus and target prevention programs. This is critical in the case of cryptosporidiosis as this pathogen is resistant to conventional water treatment practices (Betancourt and Rose, 2004). This study demonstrates that while climatic conditions typically define a habitat area of a pathogen, meteorological factors affect timing and intensity of infectious outbreaks. Weather forecasting on a local and global scale can be useful for disease forecasting allowing public health measures for disease prevention to be better targeted and focused.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors thank the support of funding agencies: the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (The Gastroenteritis and Extreme Weather Events in Elderly (GEWEL) Project (NIEHS ES 013171)).

However, analytical tools suitable for the identification of seasonal peaks are limited. We introduced a two-step procedure to determine seasonal patterns in RI and examined the relationship between daily rates of rotaviral infection and ambient temperature in cold climates in three Russian cities: Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Barnaul from 2005 to 2011. We described the structure of temporal variations using a new class of singular spectral analysis (SSA) models based on the “Caterpillar” algorithm. We then fitted Poisson polyharmonic regression (PPHR) models and examined the relationship between daily RI rates and ambient temperature. In SSA models, RI rates reached their seasonal peaks around 24 February, 5 March, and 12 March (i.e., the 55.17 ± 3.21, 64.17 ± 5.12, and 71.11 ± 7.48 day of the year) in Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Barnaul, respectively. Yet, in all three cities, the minimum temperature was observed, on average, to be on 15 January, which translates to a lag between the peak in disease incidence and time of temperature minimum of 38–40 days for Chelyabinsk, 45–49 days in Yekaterinburg, and 56–59 days in Barnaul. The proposed approach takes advantage of an accurate description of the time series data offered by the SSA-model coupled with a straightforward interpretation of the PPHR model. By better tailoring analytical methodology to estimate seasonal features and understand the relationships between infection and environmental conditions, regional and global disease forecasting can be further improved.\\n\\nKeywords: time series analysis; singular spectrum analysis; periodogram spectral analysis; Poisson polyharmonic regression model; rotavirus; seasonality; ambient temperature; cold climate; Russia\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nGlobal surveillance for major infectious diseases, such as influenza and rotaviral infection—one of the leading causes of mortality in both young children and older adults, increases the demand for reliable tools to streamline data analysis, visualization, and interpretation of surveillance records. The dynamics of many viral infections is known to have a complex non-linear, non-stationary structure due to the multiple routes of transmissions and potential amplifiers affecting host health. Viral rotaviral infections (RIs) exhibit strong seasonality, characterized by marked changes in disease incidence over a course of a calendar year when relatively short periods of high incidence alternate with prolonged periods of low incidence, indicative of virus sensitivity to environmental conditions [1 –5]. To properly guide public health intervention programs, it is important to carefully describe the dynamics of infection and...\\n\\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

Furthermore, understanding the relationship between infection and environmental temperature is essential for disease forecasting on global and local scales.\\n\\nHowever, analytical tools suitable for identification of seasonal peaks along with their uncertainty metrics are limited and rarely used in a systematic manner. In surveillance reports worldwide, seasonal peaks are often presented by the month with the highest number of cases, which is insufficient to accurately compare seasonal peaks across populations, geographic locations, and time periods. Yet, if the incidence of an infectious disease observed in a specific population is tracked in a systematic manner and is expressed in a proper chronological order at high temporal resolution, researchers can apply modern sophisticated methodology to conduct in-depth data analysis. In other words, if we assemble cases of health outcomes as they occur in time, aggregate these events with respect to time units, say into daily or weekly cases, and compile these counts or rates into so-called time series, we will be able to apply analytical methods suitable for time series data.\\n\\nInfections that are highly contagious often exhibit sharp spikes in time series of disease incidence. Infections that are highly seasonal tend to peak at the same time of the year. Methods that are most critical in describing seasonal features include models for: 1) adequate selection of a form for a long-term trend, 2) identification of a cycle length or period, and 3) detection of a seasonal peak and amplitude along with the relevant measures of uncertainty. Thus, the models describing time series of disease records have to take into account a potentially complex structure that is non-linear and non-stationary. Non-stationarity and non-linearity are likely to be present when an infection is sensitive to environmental conditions governing pathogen’s transmission and host health.\\n\\nRotavirus, one of the most common pediatric diarrheal diseases, typically peaks in cold and dry weather in both temperate and tropical climates [1–12]. However, the seasonal pattern and strength of the association between the incidence of rotaviral infection and ambient temperature, and the sensitivity of a seasonal peak of rotavirus to temperature vary. Some studies demonstrated a delay when the seasonal peak occurred 1–2 months after a nadir in ambient temperature [3, 6, 13]. It is not clear how stable the seasonal peak is and how strong the relationship between rotavirus infections and ambient temperature is in cold climates. The relationship between temperature and seasonal infection, including RI, is difficult to compare across the studies due to the marked differences in the methods applied to assess such a relationship, the differences in climatic and weather conditions, heterogeneity of RI infections across populations, degree of vaccination coverage, and many other factors. Studies that compare models to capture sensitivity of a seasonal peak of rotavirus to temperature are rare. The accuracy of assessing relationships between temperature and infection often depends on how values are aggregated across time—the more refined the time units, the higher the expected accuracy. In other words, daily time series is superior to weekly and monthly time series. Most of the studies used weekly or monthly records and, thus, created additional ambiguity with selecting the most appropriate metrics for ambient temperature, which could take a variety of forms [3, 7–10, 14]. Some studies assessed the relationship with temperature by simply comparing cold and warm seasons [9, 10, 14]. In some studies, peaks of infections were presented as the month with highest counts [6], with occasional reporting of two seasonal peaks in RI [3, 14]. Our understanding of what infection seasonality represents is currently limited by a lack of standardization of methodology for in-depth analysis of temporal variations in infections with marked seasonality and potential environmental factors that may act as proxies for seasonal change.\\n\\nDocumenting how seasonal features change over time is important in assessing the effect of broadly implemented vaccination strategies. With the growing potential for wide implementation of vaccination against rotavirus [15–19], there is increasing evidence that the seasonal pattern changes due to the fact of vaccination; for example, in Brazil the seasonal oscillations became less pronounced [16]. With the ongoing climatic changes, it could be expected that the seasonality of rotavirus might change as well. Thus, there is a clear need for establishing a baseline temporal pattern in RI and its sensitivity to environmental temperature. Such description requires a solid methodology for assessing systematic.\\n---\\n# Research Paper'),\n",

Researchers need methodologies that can accurately estimate seasonal characteristics, such as peak timing, while providing measures of uncertainty. High-quality primary medical data collection with time-referenced records is essential for effective time series analysis.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nIn previous work, we utilized harmonic regression models to capture seasonal variations in disease incidence. These models estimate parameters for sine and cosine terms, allowing researchers to identify periodic variations within a one-year cycle. The δ-method was developed to convert regression coefficients into time units, providing insights into peak timing and intensity.\\n\\nHowever, harmonic models are symmetrical and assume equal rates of increase and decrease in disease incidence. To address this limitation, we explored polyharmonic regression models, which serve as a simplified version of classical spectral analysis (SA). SA aims to identify recurrent periodic patterns in disease incidence over time.\\n\\nRecent advancements in SSA offer a promising alternative to SA, enabling the analysis of time series data without preliminary manipulation. SSA transforms one-dimensional time series into multi-dimensional trajectories, allowing for the recreation of asymmetric seasonal curves and improved peak predictions.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nIn this study, we developed a two-step modeling procedure that first identifies periodicity in the observed data and then applies PPHR models to examine the relationship between daily time series of respiratory infection (RI) rates and ambient temperature in three Russian cities from 2005 to 2011.\\n\\nUsing the SSA model, we identified the structure of temporal variation in daily RI rates and temperature. Subsequently, PPHR models were employed to estimate seasonal peaks and analyze the relationship between RI rates and temperature.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis research demonstrates the effectiveness of combining SSA and PPHR models to analyze seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence. The methodology provides a robust framework for understanding the dynamics of disease patterns and can inform public health interventions.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n[20-25] Previous studies on harmonic regression models.\\n\\n[26] Classical spectral analysis in epidemiological research.\\n\\n[27,28] Recent developments in singular spectrum analysis.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Rotavirus Incidence in Russian Cities\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Incidence in Three Russian Cities: A Study from 2005 to 2011\\n\\nWe provide the models’ assessments and an interpretation of modeling results.

Data and Methods\\n\\nWe abstracted all fully anonymized laboratory-confirmed cases of rotavirus (A08.0, ICD-10), representing rotaviral infection in three Russian cities: 12,423 cases in Chelyabinsk, 13,342 cases in Yekaterinburg, and 3,307 cases in Barnaul as recorded by the Climate–Water–Diseases–Infections (CliWaDIn) database version 1.0 [29,30]. Using the date of testing, we created daily time series of cases for each city. To compare rotavirus incidence between cities, the time series of cases were converted into time series of daily rates per 1 million persons. As denominators, we used the annual population for each city and each year: for Chelyabinsk—from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2011 (2,372 study days); for Yekaterinburg—from 1 January 2005 to 31 July 2011 (2,403 study days); and for Barnaul—from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2011 (2,191 study days) as shown in Table 1.\\n\\n# Table 1.

Daily average temperature records were obtained from the city public sites [32] and then stored, curated, and maintained by the CliWaDIn database [29].\\n\\nTwo cities, Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg, are located relatively close to each other (~193 km apart) and have over 1 million residents. Barnaul is about half the size and is 1460 km and 1520 km away from Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg, respectively (Figure 1). All three cities shared similar climate conditions according to the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system [33]. The Köppen climate classification divides climates into five main climate groups: A (tropical), B (dry), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar), with each group being divided based on seasonal precipitation and temperature patterns, also represented by a letter.\\n\\n# 2.1.

Exploratory Analysis\\n\\nThe basic SSA algorithm decomposes an original non-zero time series into four main components: trend, seasonal component, additional periodic components, and noise. An original non-zero time series, Yt, is a series Yt = (y1, ..., yN) of length N (N > 2) and with at least one value of yi when yi ≠ 0. We examined the suitability of a Poisson distribution for daily RI rates based on the distributional shape, the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis, and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. We applied the periodogram spectral analysis to identify temporal components and seasonal periodicity.\\n\\nIn the presented analysis, we constructed the SSA model (Model A) of the time series of daily RI rates using the SSA algorithm, which consists of four steps: embedding, singular value decomposition (SVD), eigentriple grouping, and diagonal averaging, as described below.\\n\\n# Step 1: Embedding\\n\\nThe main feature of the SSA algorithm is the window of length (L) where 1 < L < N. To perform the first step of embedding, we mapped the original time series into a sequence of K = N - L + 1 lagged vectors of size L:\\n\\nY = [Y1, Y2, ..., YK]\\n\\nwhere Yi = (yi, ..., yi+L-1), for 1 ≤ i ≤ K.\\n\\n# Step 2: Singular Value Decomposition\\n\\nAt the second step, we performed the SVD procedure of the trajectory matrix Y:\\n\\nY = Y1 + Y2 + ... + Yd,\\nYi = √λiUiViT, i = 1, ..., d\\n\\nwhere {U1, ..., Ud} is the corresponding orthonormal system of the eigenvectors of the matrix S = YYT with λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ ... ≥ λd > 0 as the ordered non-zero eigenvalues, and Vi = YTUi/√λi are the factoring matrices.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Temporal Patterns in Daily RI Rates\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.equation {\\nfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\\nbackground-color: #f4f4f4;\\npadding: 10px;\\nborder-left: 3px solid #3498db;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Temporal Patterns in Daily RI Rates\\n\\n# 2.3. Poisson Polyharmonic Regression (PPHR) Model\\n\\nTo describe the temporal patterns in the time series of daily RI rates and to estimate peak timing, we modeled the random sequences, Yt, in the form of additive mixtures of harmonic components with periods corresponding to the number of days per year using a stationary regression with Poisson-distributed discrete noise, et where E{e} = 0 and Var{e} = σ2. The general form of a PPHR model is:\\n\\nYt = exp(d0 + &sum;i=1k (αi sin(2πiωt) + βi cos(2πiωt)) + et)\\n\\nwhere Yt is the outcome interest at time t; t = 1, 2, . . . , N is time in days, where N is the number of days in a time series; d0 is an intercept and the exp{d0} reflects mean daily values over the study period. The periodic sin and cos components have a frequency of ω = 1/365.25; α, β, i = 1, . . . , k are the estimated parameters of the model (or regression coefficients) for k—number of the periodic components. This model can also contain the trend terms reflecting the general dynamics of change during the observation period.\\n\\nFrom the general form, we selected the components that were most reasonable to describe the annual and semi-annual oscillations based on the periodogram spectral analysis and the results of SSA modeling (a detailed explanation of how SSA modeling was used to build the PPHR model is provided in Section 3). Thus, we built the PPHR for the daily rates with the following structure (Model B):\\n\\nYt = exp(d0 + d1t + d2t2 + d3t3 + α1sin(2πωt) + β1cos(2πωt) + α2sin(4πωt) + β2cos(4πωt) + et)\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Analysis of RI Rates and Ambient Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.equation {\\nfont-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\nborder-left: 3px solid #007BFF;\\npadding: 10px;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Analysis of the Relationship between Daily RI Rates and Ambient Temperature\\n\\nIn this section, we explore the relationship between daily respiratory infection (RI) rates and ambient temperature using various statistical models.

Introduction\\n\\nThis research paper investigates the relationship between rotaviral infection (RI) rates and temperature variations in three Russian cities: Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Barnaul, over the period from 2005 to 2011.\\n\\n# 2. Methodology\\n\\nTo estimate the model parameters obtained with PPHR approaches, we used the iterative Gauss–Newton least squares method. We plotted the values of RI rates estimated from Models A, B’, and C’. Finally, we estimated the average seasonal peaks of disease incidence from Model A, Model B’, and Model C’ and estimated the difference (lag) between the peak timing in disease incidence and the time when temperature reaches its minimum.\\n\\nThe quality of fit for the constructed models was evaluated by the coefficient of determination D, reflecting the overall proportion of variance in Yt explained by the model components and the proximity to the Poisson-distributed residuals. All analysis was performed using Statistica 12.0 statistical software. Codes for SSA models were based on the “Caterpillar” SSA algorithm and can be requested from the author.

Results\\n\\nThe daily time series of RI rates (estimated from reported daily counts and interpolated city population) and average temperature for three cities: Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Barnaul, 2005–2011, are shown in Figure 2. All three cities shared similar temperate climatic conditions with cold winters and relatively warm summers. Overall, the RI rate in Barnaul was twice as lower as compared to the two other cities. For all cities, RI rates showed a slow upward trend and a well-pronounced recurrent increase with high spikes in the wintertime, typically after the nadir in temperature and prolonged periods with low rates. In some years, there were irregular spikes in RI during summer months.\\n\\nAs part of an exploratory analysis, we identified the distributional and temporal structure of time series of daily RI rates. The distributions of RI rates appeared to be right-skewed based on high values of skewness and kurtosis and driven by the seasonal winter spikes when daily maximums were approximately 10 fold higher than the annual median values, although the Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests rejected the Poisson assumption due to the high contribution of days with low rates.\\n\\n# Table 2.

Results\\n\\nThe variance explained by Model A was consistently higher compared to Model B, by approximately 3–4%. For the simplified Model B’, the difference increased by 5–7.5% for all three cities: 52.7% versus 47.75%; 62.77% versus 57.45%; and 43.06% versus 35.54% for Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Barnaul, respectively.\\n\\nThe results suggest that the approximation of the time series of daily RI rates with Model B’ was relatively crude and had limited ability to pick up the high values yet was sufficient to describe the seasonality. The inclusion of the ambient temperature predictors to Models B and B’ offered a slight improvement but did not reach the fit of Model A.\\n\\n# 4. Discussion\\n\\nThe contribution of trend and seasonal components in explaining the variance of time series of daily RI rates differed by model and by city. In general, the trend and annual cycle for all three cities explained most of the outcome variance. There was a significant positive trend in the RI rates in all three cities.\\n\\nAmong PPHR models, Model B offered the most comprehensive description of temporal components, including non-linear variations in trend and the semi-annual seasonal component. The coefficients of the trend function corresponding to the second and third degrees were not statistically significant, justifying the simplified version (Model B’).\\n\\n# 5. Conclusion\\n\\nThe analysis indicates that the time series of daily RI rates exhibit significant periodicity, with annual and semi-annual components being crucial for accurate modeling.

The inclusion of the temperature component with the selected lag increased the accuracy of the identification of the time series of daily respiratory infection (RI) rates. The immediate effect of temperature (RR1) was non-significant (p > 0.05), yet the lagged effect (RR2) was statistically significant (p < 0.05) indicating that low ambient temperature at its nadir correlated with high RI rates. The estimates of the relative risks (RR) associated with an increase by 1°C for the lagged temperature effect were significant for all cities, as shown by the values of lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval (LCIRR2 and UCIRR2). However, the percentage of the variance of the time series explained by the temperature components was low: 0.01%–0.04% (immediate effect) and 0.26%–0.49% (lagged effect), depending on the city (Table 4).\\n\\nNext, the time series of daily RI rates were reconstructed by models. The results of the selected comprehensive Models A, B’, and C’ are shown in Figure 5. As expected, all models depicted the general seasonal nature of RI and predicted from 36% to 59% of variability. Model A, obtained via Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) modeling, provided the most refined structure of the studied time series of RI rates. In addition to a well-pronounced winter peak, Model A revealed irregularities and unusual summertime peaks.\\n\\nAs expected, the two harmonic regression models, Models B’ and C’, identified a temporal structure with one seasonal peak for daily RI rates in three cities similarly to Model A. Because Model C’ included a term for ambient temperature, it depicted variations in RI rates due to the ambient temperature, mostly noted when RI rate reached its peaks. Thus, Model C’ demonstrated a modest contribution of temperature in predicting RI rates.\\n\\nFigure 5.

With the proposed approach, we were able to reconstruct the daily incidence of infections in each city and demonstrate with high accuracy that, while the general seasonal shape of the RI incidence looked the same, each city had its own seasonal features. Despite the substantial distances between Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Barnaul, the peak temperature was observed on the same date, 15 January, in all three cities. The peaks of RI ranged from mid-February to early April, exhibiting a 9–16-day shift in peak incidence among the cities. Remarkably, the lag between the time of temperature minimum and the time of the rotavirus incidence maximum depended on the city and was approximately ~40 days in Chelyabinsk, ~47 days in Yekaterinburg, and ~58 days in Barnaul.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus Incidence: A Study of Environmental and Socio-Demographic Factors\\n\\nThe time of the rotavirus incidence maximum depended on the city and was approximately ~40 days in Chelyabinsk, ~47 days in Yekaterinburg, and ~58 days in Barnaul. After adjusting for seasonality, the contribution of the environmental temperature to the explained variance of the time series of daily rotavirus infection (RI) rates was quite small for both immediate and lagged effects (0.01%–0.04% and 0.26%–0.5%, respectively). It is unlikely that these differences will be detected if one applies a standard approach of using monthly records and reporting a month with the highest counts or rates.\\n\\nThese observations raise a fundamental question of why peaks occurred at certain times. Diseases do not read calendars and people are unlikely to choose a specific day to be sick. Thus, if in specific locations RI rates are peaking with a remarkable precision at a specific time every year, this consistency is important to note. The existing theories for RI seasonality stipulate that many socio-demographic and environmental factors contribute to the seasonal change in RI incidence, including the effects of vaccination, age-specific symptomatology, population composition and birth rates, genotypic profile of locally circulated strains, extreme environmental temperature on viral composition and stability, and the effects of overall climatic changes in continental climates. Yet, the absolute and relative contributions of these factors are unknown and require further investigations.\\n\\nIt is easy to speculate that the RI seasonality is complex and depends on many factors. However, it is not easy to find an explanation why it is complex and how those factors affect seasonality. At the moment, no studies yet offer a solid theory on disease seasonality. With this study, we had started with temperature as the most pronounced environmental indicator in cold climates, yet the suggested method has the strong potential to detect complex variations in a temporal behavior of a seasonal disease and consider more than one factor.\\n\\nThe delays between a peak in rotaviral infection and a nadir in ambient temperature and precipitation were noted in many studies. In the temperate climate of England, Wales, Scotland, and The Netherlands, the effect of temperature was delayed by up to four weeks for reported rotaviral infections. For tropical climates, a meta-analysis of 26 studies conducted between 1975 and 2003 demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between monthly rotavirus incidence and climatological variables such as temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. In a recent study, we found significant correlation at a 2 month lag, indicating the delayed effects of cold and dry conditions on rotavirus incidence in Costa Rica. Other studies have also reported negative lagged correlations between rotavirus and both temperature and precipitation in tropical and temperate regions of South Asia. There is clearly an interest in identifying the order in which RI peaked in specific locations. Yet, most of studies that attempted to estimate the lag between environmental parameters and RI or examine the sequence of RI peak timing opted out to use monthly counts or incidence, which substantially reduces the accuracy of estimation.\"),\n",

The most common reporting of peak timing is a month with the highest number of cases or highest rates observed over multiple years. For example, a two-year multi-city study in Russia to characterize rotaviral infection among patients hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis suggested that the peak seasons of hospitalization due to the fact of RI were winter and spring, from December through May, based on a visual inspection. When we applied the δ-method, we were able to estimate the range at which a peak occurs and to better characterize the shape of a seasonal curve. For instance, we have reported that, in Costa Rica, hospitalizations due to the presence of rotavirus in young children, on average, peak between late-February and early-March. In India and Bangladesh, the primary peak in reported RI was observed in late-December to late-February with a smaller secondary peak in summer months of June–August. By using daily records, we substantially increased the estimation accuracy. For example, we determined that in the United States, hospitalizations due to the fact of RI among older adults peaked on day 80 (95%; CI: 75–84) which is between 16–25 March and which is in striking agreement with our findings. The daily records examined in this study represent all ages, yet RI is more common in children than in adults and the peak timing among age groups may vary, still mostly reflecting the younger population.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Seasonal Patterns of Rotaviral Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns of Rotaviral Infections\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis research paper explores the seasonal patterns of rotaviral infections in various regions, particularly focusing on the implications for public health interventions and resource allocation.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThe shift from symptomatic to non-symptomatic infection has significant implications for understanding the epidemiology of rotaviral infections.

Introduction\\n\\nThe study of infectious diseases often requires understanding their seasonal patterns and the environmental factors influencing them. This paper presents a two-step modeling procedure that leverages the strengths of SSA and harmonic regression.\\n\\n# 2. Methodology\\n\\nThe SSA model (Model A) provides insights into the temporal structure of infectious diseases, while polyharmonic models (Models B and C) offer a simpler interpretation of seasonal components. The combination of these methods enhances the accuracy of predictions regarding disease peaks and their duration.\\n\\n# 3. Results\\n\\nOur findings indicate that the SSA model outperforms traditional polyharmonic models in explaining the variance of the time series data related to rotaviral infections.\\n\\n# 4. Discussion\\n\\nThe hybrid modeling approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of the temporal structure of infectious diseases, facilitating better resource allocation and public health strategies.\\n\\n# 5. Conclusions\\n\\nThe two-step modeling procedure to examine seasonal peaks in rotaviral infection and the relationship between infection and ambient temperature allows to take advantage of the precision offered by singular spectrum analysis (SSA)—a new class of spectral analysis model—and the simplicity and interpretability of harmonic regression models. The ability to better quantify disease seasonality and its complex relationships with environmental parameters opens up new opportunities for accurate characterization of global disease patterns, optimizing resource allocation and health care delivery, understanding the contribution of factors governing multifaceted disease seasonality, and, eventually, for developing disease forecasting scenarios associated with prevention strategies and climate change.\\n\\n# 6.

Over the 10-year interval, the average annual rate was determined to be 78.4 ± 15.0 cases per 100,000, with an upward trend. Rates were higher in males than in females, regardless of age, and highest in children less than 5 years old. Major regional differences were detected, with the highest rates in Wales and the southwest and the lowest in the southeast. The disease displayed a seasonal pattern, and increased campylobacter rates were found to be correlated with temperature. The most marked seasonal effect was observed for children under the age of 5. The seasonal pattern of campylobacter infections indicated a linkage with environmental factors rather than food sources. Therefore, public health interventions should not be restricted to food-borne approaches, and the epidemiology of the seasonal peak in human campylobacter infections may best be understood through studies in young children.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nNearly 30 years ago, campylobacter infection emerged as a leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis in developed countries. Two species, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, are responsible for over 99% of human campylobacter infections. Major infection sources include undercooked poultry, contaminated milk, untreated water, and animal contact. The public health consequences of human campylobacter infection are large, in part because of its high incidence. In developed countries, campylobacter causes more illnesses than Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. combined. Only a fraction of cases are reported, and some estimates suggest as much as 1% of the population in the United States and Europe is affected by campylobacter each year. Effective prevention and control strategies to reduce the population burden of campylobacter infections require a robust understanding of the epidemiology of this disease.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Epidemiological Data\\n\\nCampylobacter data were obtained from the Health Protection Agency, London, United Kingdom, and included all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1999 (n = 440,012). Cases associated with foreign travel or known to be part of community or family outbreaks were excluded, leaving 401,270 cases for analysis.\\n\\n# Demographic Data\\n\\nDemographic data for England and Wales, obtained from the Office for National Statistics, provided denominators for calculation of incidence rates. Mid-year populations categorized by age, gender, and Health Authority were obtained from 1990 to 1999.\\n\\n# Meteorological Data\\n\\nDaily meteorological data were obtained from the British Atmospheric Data Centre. Daily values for minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall, and hours of sunshine were retrieved from 66 meteorological stations throughout England and Wales.\\n\\n# Analysis\\n\\nThe statistical software package SAS (version 8.2) was used to carry out statistical analysis. The rates were transformed with the Freeman-Tukey square root to improve the model assumptions.\\n\\nCorresponding author: Rita R.

Time series of weekly campylobacter incidence (weekly cases per 100,000) and environmental factors, by region.\\n\\nMales represented 53.7% of campylobacter cases in the study and consistently experienced higher rates (Table 1; Fig. 3A). This difference was observed in all regions throughout the time period and in all age groups. Campylobacter incidence rates were highest in children under 5 years of age, especially in those under 1 year of age (Table 1; Fig. 3B). A second peak was observed in the 20-to-34-year age group, and incidence slowly tapered off with older groups. Overall, the time series showed that patterns by age and gender were observed consistently throughout annual variations.\\n\\n# Age Group and Gender Pattern\\n\\nWhen age-specific analyses were undertaken, the most marked seasonal variations in campylobacter rates were observed for children under 5 years of age (Fig. 3B). Campylobacter incidence in infants (those less than 1 year old) exhibited multiple peaks, with the highest in spring, while children aged 1 to 4 years experienced a single sharp peak in the spring. The annual peak in the children under 5 preceded the peak in adult groups by an average of 2 weeks (P &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 3B). The annual peak in the male population usually preceded the peak in the female population by 1 or 2 weeks, but the difference between the two groups was not significant (Fig. 3A).\\n\\n# Seasonality\\n\\nA marked seasonal pattern was observed (Fig. 2), with the seasonal rise starting at the beginning of May and the peak typically occurring between mid-June and mid-July (Fig. 4). The date and shape of the peak varied with geographical location. In Wales, a uniquely consistent pattern was observed, with a sharp well-defined spring peak occurring earlier (in early June) than in other areas. By contrast, in the southeast of England, the seasonal increase was less pronounced, and the peak incidence was in late June.\\n\\n# Environmental Factors\\n\\nAverage weekly temperature, precipitation, and hours of sunshine were included in the analysis. Time series by region showed the relationship of campylobacter incidence to the environmental parameters (Fig. 2).\\n\\nMultiple regression analysis showed that daily average temperature, precipitation, and sunshine were significantly associated with campylobacter rates (R2 = 0.2342; P &lt; 0.001).\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Incidence\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.table th, .table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\n.table th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Incidence\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the correlation between environmental factors and the incidence of Campylobacter infections.

The epidemiological results of this study are in general agreement with current knowledge. That is, incidence rates, trends, and patterns for age and gender distribution match observations of campylobacter infections in developed countries (21). The higher male incidence, though typical, has not been fully explained (2, 21). It was observed in all age groups, suggesting a higher susceptibility in males rather than distinctive at-risk behaviors. Higher incidences in children under 5 and, to a lesser extent, young adults, have been reported previously (21). Here we further show the 1-to-4-years age group especially exhibits the seasonal peak of campylobacteriosis. Children under 1 year also showed high campylobacter incidence during the spring peak, but other peaks were also present throughout the year. Protective maternal immunity transferred to infants (42) and weaning at different ages may contribute to the less-clear picture in infants.\\n\\nSince 1999, a decline in incidence has been observed in the United Kingdom (18). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention observed a slow decrease since 1996 (19, 20). Neither the increase in the 1990s in Europe (21) nor the decline since the end of the decade has been fully explained (19). Advances in food safety and stricter food regulations have probably contributed to the slight decrease in campylobacter incidence over the last few years (20).\\n\\nSource of bias. In seeking to explain our observations, it was important to identify potential sources of bias which might have affected our findings. For any emerging pathogen, such as campylobacter, early changes in trend may simply reflect changing laboratory practice rather than real changes in disease incidence. By 1990, however, laboratory methods for campylobacter isolation and reporting of positive results to national surveillance were well established. Clinical practice might also have affected our results.

Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus infection was globally responsible for 29.3% (146,500 deaths) of all diarrhoea-related deaths among children below 5 years of age in 2015 (Wang et al., 2016), and 128,500 deaths among the same population in the following year (Troeger et al., 2018). In the context of Nepal, rotavirus infection has been estimated to cause 50–100 deaths per 100,000 infection cases reported each year among children under 5 years of age (Tate et al., 2012). The worldwide distribution of rotavirus infection, regardless of hygiene levels, socio-economic status, and food and air quality, highlights the important role of weather factors in the transmission of rotavirus diarrhoea (Levy et al., 2009; Martinez et al., 2016; Atchison et al., 2010). Rotavirus infection has been reported to show distinct seasonality with a winter peak in temperate regions, while a less pronounced seasonality has been observed in tropical regions where the infection prevails all year round (Cook et al., 1990). In addition to tropical countries, year-round prevalence of rotavirus infection has been reported in several South Asian countries, including Bangladesh (Cook et al., 1990; Stoll et al., 1982; Bresee et al., 2004; Nelson et al., 2008).\\n\\nKathmandu city lies in a warm, temperate zone, situated at an average elevation of 1400 m above sea level, and is characterised by a subtropical humid to subtropical highland climate. The annual average summer temperature varies from 28 °C to 30 °C, with the average winter temperature varying between 8 °C and 10 °C. The city receives monsoon rainfall with an average of 1407 mm of rain per annum. According to the census of 2011, the total population of Kathmandu district was 1,744,240 with a population density of 4416 per sq. km. The population of the under five year age group was 111,600 (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2012). With a low Gross National income of around US $2472 and a lower Human Development Index (0.578), the socioeconomic development status of people living in this region is below the average value for South Asia countries (United Nations Development Programme, 2018). It is estimated that nearly 350 MLD (million litre per day) of wastewater is produced in Nepal, of which only 5% is being treated currently (Jha, 2014). Direct discharge of untreated wastewater and sewage into the water bodies is a common practice in Kathmandu that has led to the transformation of water bodies into open sewage with contaminants and enteropathogens. In the context of Kathmandu, a wastewater treatment plant of capacity 17.3 MLD is partially in operation to clean up a major water body, i.e., Bagmati river (Jha, 2014).\\n\\nA hospital-based program of rotavirus infection surveillance was initiated in 2005 at Kanti Children Hospital, Kathmandu, through a collaboration between the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University, Nagasaki University, and the University of Liverpool (Sherchand et al., 2009). This program was later integrated into the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network to continue rotavirus monitoring in Kathmandu, Nepal (Nelson et al., 2009). Over the last decade, the annual prevalence of rotavirus infection among children under 5 years in Kathmandu has been reported to be between 22.2% and 33%. Infections occur year-round, with a higher incidence during the winter months (Sherchand et al., 2013; Sherchand et al., 2009; Sherchand et al., 2012; Sherchand et al., 2018). A number of studies have used rigorous statistical methods to estimate the effects of climatic factors on rotavirus infections, while controlling for confounding variables and seasonal and long-term variation (Atchison et al., 2010; D'Souza et al., 2007; Hashizume et al., 2008; Hervás et al., 2014; van Gaalen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Colston et al., 2019). However, few studies have been carried out in a warm, temperate region like Kathmandu city.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doi': 'paper 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141376 23'}, page_content=\"Given the lack of a unifying explanation for varying degrees of rotavirus seasonality across the world (Patel et al., 2013), investigating the role of local climatic conditions may provide insights into the transmission and epidemiology of rotavirus infection for a given location (Levy et al., 2009), especially for the city of Kathmandu with its unique climatic and socioeconomic characteristics. Although the rotavirus burden has been consistently substantial over the past few decades, a rotavirus vaccine has not been introduced into the National Immunization Program of Nepal (Sherchand et al., 2018). As such, a better understanding of the role of climatic factors and seasonal patterns in the spread of rotavirus in Kathmandu may support the implementation of effective vaccine intervention programs in the future (D'Souza et al., 2007). Discerning the role of environmental factors in virus transmission may help public health authorities design a more systematic plan for the prevention of rotavirus infection in Kathmandu during high-risk periods. Furthermore, it may facilitate exploration of the broader effects of climate variation and climate change on rotavirus transmission in the Nepalese context (Martinez et al., 2016). Thus, this study aims to explore the association between climatic factors and rotavirus infections among children younger than 5 years in the warm temperate zone of Kathmandu, Nepal, and to provide scientific evidence to local health authorities to support the design of an appropriate intervention program for the prevention of rotavirus infections in the context of a changing climate.\\n\\n# 2. Methods\\n\\n# 2.1. Data source\\n\\nWe included the weekly reported counts of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus cases among children under 5 years of age attending Kanti Children Hospital, Kathmandu, based on the illness onset date across a four-year period (2013–2016) as the primary outcome. Surveillance data on the weekly count of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus cases were obtained from the Public Health Research Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University, Nepal (Sherchand et al., 2018), a member site of the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network (Nelson et al., 2009). All participants enrolled in the surveillance program were screened for the presence of rotavirus antigen in their stool samples using Enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kits (ProSpecT™ Rotavirus, Oxoid Ltd., UK), followed by confirmation via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Sherchand et al., 2018).\\n\\nDaily climate data from Kathmandu district were obtained from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Nepal, and weekly means were calculated for temperature variables and relative humidity. Weekly cumulative rainfall totals were calculated from daily records. Meteorological data from Kathmandu Airport station were used as these provided better coverage of the study location and more complete data.\\n\\n# 2.2.

Discussion\\n\\n      We have used the state of art modelling technique (distributed lag\\nnonlinear model), widely used in environmental epidemiology, to as-\\nsess the short-term effect of temperature variability on the risk of rota-\\nvirus infection in Kathmandu, Nepal, while adjusting for seasonality,\\nlong-term variation, lag-effect and other possible meteorological factors\\nsuch as rainfall and humidity. Despite the year-round detection of rota-\\nvirus infection, our study has found that lower temperature poses a\\nhigher risk of rotavirus diarrhoea incidence among children under\\n5 years of age in Kathmandu, demonstrating an inverse non-linear rela-\\ntionship with all three indices of temperature. Our findings with regard\\nto the increased risk of rotavirus transmission on colder days of the year\\nin Kathmandu supports public health practitioners and health policy-\\nmakers to design and deploy effective intervention programs for the\\nprevention of rotavirus infection in Nepal, considering the climatic as-\\npect of virus transmission. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Divi-\\nsion of Nepal, in coordination with electronic and print media, might\\nusefully broadcast special alerts to promote precautionary measures\\nduring winter high-risk periods, such as improved hygiene practices\\n(e.g., hand washing, proper dispensing of baby diapers), and advice to\\nreduce unnecessary physical interaction with children to prevent rota-\\nvirus transmission form carrier to susceptible children (Center for\\nDisease Control and Prevention, 2018). In the absence of mandatory ro-\\ntavirus vaccinations in Nepal, these findings further highlight the im-\\nportance of identifying specific pathways (interactions between host\\nand environmental factors) through which a higher risk of rotavirus\\ntransmission is mediated during colder days in Kathmandu.\\n      Apart from the increased survival duration of viral particles at low\\ntemperatures, the biological reasons behind the higher transmission\\nrate of rotavirus infection at lower temperature remains unclear (Patel\\net al., 2013). A plausible explanation for the increased risk of rotavirus\\ninfection at lower temperatures could be a due to poorer hygienic prac-\\ntices in cooler conditions, for example, reduced hand washing frequency\\nduring cold weather, which may increase chances of faeco-oral trans-\\nmission of rotavirus (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Con-\\ntrol, 2019). We speculate that the reluctance of people to leave a warm\\nplace, or the irregular availability of warm water in high-risk areas of\\nsub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, may compromise the hand hygiene\\npractices of mothers and caregivers during cold weather. In the context\\nof Kathmandu district, 58.7% of households live in rental housing\\n(Himalayan News Service, 2018), and the average number of rooms\\nper household in Nepal is 4.4 (Government of Nepal National Planning\\nComission, 2016). Given the higher population density (4416 person\\nper sq.km) of Kathmandu district (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2012),\\nand the lower number of rooms per household, it is highly likely that\\nresidents living in rented houses are living in overcrowded conditions.\\nIndeed, an increased risk of rotavirus transmission in cold weather\\ndue to the overcrowding of people in rented households has been pre-\\nviously reported in England and Wales (Atchison et al., 2010; Sethi\\net al., 2001). Hence, increased proximity among people living in over-\\ncrowded conditions is likely to cause more frequent physical interaction\\nbetween individuals, especially between susceptible children and their\\ncaregivers, which may be a key facilitator of the transmission of\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Rotavirus and Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n\\n# Impact of Temperature on Rotavirus Transmission in Kathmandu\\n\\n# Overall Effect of Temperature on Rotavirus\\n\\nFig. 2.

Bhandari et al. / Science of the Total Environment 748 (2020) 141376\\n\\nThe plausibility (if any exists) behind the prolonged lag effect of temperature in their study remains unexplained. Apart from temperature, we did not find a significant association between rotavirus infection and other meteorological variables i.e., mean relative humidity and total weekly rainfall. These findings mirror the results of studies from Great Britain, the Netherlands and Turkey (Atchison et al., 2010; Celik et al., 2015), and resonate with the findings of other epidemiological studies and laboratory based evidence (Levy et al., 2009; Sattar et al., 1984; Jagai et al., 2012). However, our findings did differ from those conducted in Australia (D'Souza et al., 2007), Bangladesh (Hashizume et al., 2008) and Hong Kong (Wang et al., 2018). Such differences could be due to geographical location, heterogeneities in socioeconomic conditions, demographic factors, behavioural factors or other environmental factors that may interact with climatic factors, complicating the dynamics of disease epidemiology at a local level (Pitzer et al., 2011).\\n\\nThe use of data from a single sentinel surveillance site may be a limitation of our study, as surveillance data only captures the proportion of cases seeking medical attention at the given facility. Hence, it is highly likely that rotavirus burden in Kathmandu is much higher, and the data analysed in our study may not necessarily represent all cases. Likewise, the use of weekly data spanning the period of four years for the purpose of a time series analysis may be another limitation of our study. We carried out subgroup analysis for gender, different age groups (stratified by months) and degree of dehydration to see if they are differentially associated with the exposure variables. Probably, due to the small sample size of our study, we could not find a significant association among gender, age groups and degree of dehydration with any of the exposure variables (maximum, minimum and mean temperature) used in the multivariate analysis (results not shown). Ideally, for trend analysis on the short-term effect of exposure-response relationships in environmental epidemiology, daily data for a considerably longer time period is desired. Rotavirus is a highly contagious disease with an increased likelihood of transmission from person-to-person contact. As such, failure to include a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in our analysis may undermine the influence of host immunity on rotavirus transmission in our ecological model (Imai et al., 2015). A common problem associated with conducting epidemiological studies in low- and middle-income countries is the unavailability of updated information on demographic characteristics of the study population. The unavailability of this data, and other relevant health information, constrained us from conducting regression analysis using SIR parameters in our time series model. Despite these limitations, the major strengths of our study are the use of laboratory-confirmed cases on rotavirus infections furnished by a member laboratory of the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network, and the use of a distributed lag non-linear model for estimation of the exposure-response relationship.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our analysis demonstrated an inverse non-linear association between rotavirus incidence and all three indices of temperature, indicating a higher risk of infection during the cooler times of the year, and lower risk during the hotter times, in Kathmandu, Nepal.\\n\\n# Abbreviations\\n\\nAIC - Akaike Information Criterion\\n\\nCI - confidence interval\\n\\nDLNM - distributed lag nonlinear model\\n\\neCI - empirical confidence interval\\n\\nELISA - enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay\\n\\nNS - natural cubic spline\\n\\nRR - relative risk\\n\\nRT-PCR - reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\\n\\nSIR - Susceptible-Infected-Recovered\\n\\nWHO - World Health Organisation\\n\\n# Ethical Consideration\\n\\nThe study was granted ethical approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of The University of Adelaide (H-2018-236), and Ethical Review Board of the Nepal Health Research Council (Reg. no. 560/2018).

A hydrological model was used to predict surface-water flow in the Tyne catchment over 5 years. We analysed associations between population-adjusted Campylobacter case rate and environmental factors hypothesized to be important in disease using a two-stage modelling framework. First, we investigated associations between temporal variation in case rate in relation to surface-water flow, temperature, evapotranspiration and rainfall, using linear mixed-effects models. Second, we used the random effects for the first model to quantify how spatial variation in static landscape features of soil and land use impacted on the likely differences between subcatchment associations of case rate with the temporal variables.\\n\\nResults: Population-adjusted Campylobacter case rates were associated with periods of high predicted surface-water flow, and during above average temperatures. Subcatchments with cattle on stagnogley soils, and to a lesser extent sheep plus cattle grazing, had higher Campylobacter case rates.\\n\\nConclusions: Areas of stagnogley soils with mixed livestock grazing may be more vulnerable to both Campylobacter spread and exposure during periods of high rainfall, with resultant increased risk of human cases of the disease.\\n\\n# Key words:\\n\\nCampylobacter, hydrology, livestock, rainfall, soils\\n\\n© The Author 2017.

The number of human cases of disease is strongly seasonal, with peaks in early summer (June) that vary regionally. Infection is mainly caused by consumption of contaminated chicken and beef, and chicken has been identified as a particular problem with the majority of samples bought at UK supermarkets found to be contaminated by Campylobacter. Although the majority of human Campylobacter cases can be linked to food consumption, between 30% and 50% of cases may be a result of infection from the wider environment. The survival and distribution of Campylobacter in the environment change with both space and time, and this will interact with how humans are exposed to the organism. However, given that the numbers of reported Campylobacter cases are dominated by infection through food, and eating behaviour changes seasonally, this makes it harder to detect cases of infection from the wider environment. Seasonal variation in the prevalence of Campylobacter has not been detected in poultry or sheep, but the amounts of Campylobacter being shed by dairy cattle does change seasonally. To understand the epidemiology of Campylobacter therefore requires analyses that include spatial-temporal patterns, livestock management, meteorology and environmental conditions.\\n\\nMolecular epidemiological investigations suggest that the spring/early summer peak of Campylobacter infections may be largely due to environmental exposure. Complex pathways of primary and secondary interactions occur between Campylobacter reservoirs in soil, water, wild animals and livestock in the countryside, and whereas there is evidence for a wide distribution of Campylobacter in the environment, the health risks posed for humans remain unclear. Sequence type (ST) analyses of Campylobacter in Cheshire in North West England have indicated the particular importance of dairy cattle, and cattle-derived strains were most often isolated in humans (particularly the ST-61 complex). Cattle appear to have generally higher infection levels than sheep, at about 90% for herds and 55% for flocks. Campylobacter deposited in faeces from individual sheep and cattle has been estimated at 102 to 107 colony-forming units/g, although this may be focused on a small number of ‘high-shedding’ animals within a herd.\\n\\nCampylobacter survival at any point location will depend on both local soil type and local weather conditions. Soil type is of particular importance as it affects soil moisture, chemistry and infiltration within the soil; some studies have indicated that Campylobacter is twice as common in clay compared with non-clay soils. Campylobacter is microaerophilic and is extremely sensitive to desiccation in warm dry weather and UV radiation, and it survives better in the environment at temperatures less than 10°C compared with over 25°C. Some Campylobacter populations, however, also appear to have adaptive tolerance in the field to some environmental stresses. Wet conditions (due to soil type and/or weather) will therefore aid not only Campylobacter survival, but also increase its risk of being spread further during subsequent surface-water flow events. Human Campylobacter infection from environmental sources will be the product of two processes: the presence of the pathogen and the mechanisms leading to human exposure. There remains considerable uncertainty about the role of different environmental factors in determining Campylobacter survival in the landscape, transmission between hosts and infection in humans. The pathogen is likely to be distributed in large quantities across the landscape through manure spreading, grazing livestock and transmission between domesticated animals and wildlife such as badgers, rabbits and wild birds.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacter Transmission Pathways\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Campylobacter Transmission Pathways in the River Tyne Catchment'),\n",

Most catchment-level landscape models of bacterial movement have focused on overland flow, although there have been recent attempts to produce models for small catchments which couple both surface and subsurface movement of bacterial pathogens.\\n\\nQuantifying the links between human disease and water flow is difficult because of differences in spatial and temporal scales: the cases of disease are comparatively infrequent, with delays between infection and reporting, and high-precision predictions of hydrological flow generally work best for small catchments. For large catchments such as that of the River Tyne, where spatio-temporal patterns in Campylobacter cases become more obvious, modelling surface flows becomes challenging.\\n\\nStorm events are likely to increase the amount of overland flow and are known to be important in the movement of other bacteria such as Escherichia coli. The frequency and intensity of these events are likely to increase with climate change, but their impacts on potential spread of Campylobacter are unclear.\\n\\n# Objectives\\n\\nThe primary aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the impact and transmission pathways of environmentally acquired Campylobacter cases in the catchment of the River Tyne. The research had the following specific objectives:\\n\\n1. To quantify the association between occurrences of human cases of Campylobacter and temperature, rainfall, and hydrological responses of the study catchment.\\n2. To investigate the association between the occurrence of Campylobacter cases and land use and soil after adjusting for the temporal variation in weather and hydrology.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nAnalyses were undertaken using a combination of Unix shell-scripting to interface with the GRASS geographical information system, the Topmodel hydrological model, and the R statistical package. One advantage of GRASS, as the geographical information system (GIS) for this type of analysis, is that it integrates well with R.\\n\\n# Hydrological Model\\n\\n# Study Area and Division into Subcatchments\\n\\nThe Tyne catchment is approximately 2944 km2 in North East England. The landscape is highly diverse, ranging from semi-natural wild moorland habitats dominated by upland plant species and sheep grazing through lowland arable to the urban sprawl of Tyneside. The Topmodel hydrological model was used to predict surface-water overland flow in the Tyne catchment from 1 January 2004 to 31 March 2009, using landscape topology and weather data as inputs.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n[23] Author et al., Year.

This was achieved through linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) with population-adjusted Campylobacter case rate as the response, weather and hydrology as fixed effects and subcatchment as the random effect, using the R package ‘nlme’ which can also account for temporal autocorrelation.\\n\\nThe number of reported cases of Campylobacter per month in each subcatchment was obtained from the Health Protection Agency in 2010 (now Public Health England); they were available for 63 months, from January 2004 to March 2009. The HPA data provide the six-figure UK residential postcode for each Campylobacter case, and these were converted into Ordnance Survey GB National Grid eastings and northings and imported into the GIS. Cases were then overlaid onto the map of the subcatchments. The Campylobacter case data were log-transformed (corrected by log-transformed population size in each sub-catchment), to create a ‘population-adjusted Campylobacter case rate’ in each subcatchment per month. Topmodel outputs were daily; therefore the mean monthly temperature, rainfall, potential evapotranspiration (Ep) and saturated overland flow (qo) were calculated before comparison with the Campylobacter case data.\\n\\n# Model Formulation\\n\\nA standard mixed-effects model can be expressed in matrix formulation as:\\n\\nyi  = Xb + Zbi + ei\\n\\nbi  ~ N(0, W)\\n\\nei  ~ N(0, σ²K)\\n\\nwhere yi is a vector of observations in the i’th group, Xi is the model matrix of fixed-effects regressors for observations in group i, b is a vector of fixed-effects coefficients, Zi is a matrix of regressors for random effects for observations in group i, bi is a vector of random effects for group i, ei is a vector of errors for observations in each group, W is the covariance matrix for random effects and σ²K is the covariance matrix for errors in group i.\\n\\nThis formulation gives considerable flexibility in the structure of mixed-effects models. In our study, we used subcatchment as the grouping variable (hence index i varied from 1 to 30). We did not detect evidence of long-term increases or decreases in the population-adjusted Campylobacter case rate during the study period; therefore a random-intercepts, fixed-slopes model was fitted. Initially overland flow, temperature, evapotranspiration and rain were used as predictors, plus all interaction terms, to account for potential collinearity between predictor variables. Non-significant interaction terms were sequentially removed, and where necessary main effects, and each simplified model compared with the previous one. Non-significant main effects were retained in the final model if they were included in a significant interaction term. Model fitting was done via maximum likelihood (ML) rather than the default restricted maximum likelihood (REML), because the fixed effects changed with each model. When comparing models, those with a lower Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were selected.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doi': 'paper 10.1093/ije/dyx217 28'}, page_content='After identifying the best linear mixed-effects model, autocorrelation function (ACF) plots were constructed to check for evidence of temporal autocorrelation in the residuals. Initial modelling efforts were focused on identification of the best predictors (i.e. the fixed effects), and then improving these models to account for any temporal autocorrelation. Autoregressive (AR) moving average (MA) correlation terms were added, testing over a range of daily lags for p (autoregressive) and q (moving average) between 0 and 3 to find the optimum values to correct for temporal autocorrelation. This approach has the advantage of exploring all correction options from pure autoregressive (p > 0 and q = 0), pure moving average (p = 0 and q > 0) or joint autoregressive moving-average (ARMA; p > 0 and q > 0), until the optimal correction is identified, by altering the structure of Ki in the covariance matrix.\\n\\nAfter identification of an appropriate AR, MA or ARMA correlation function (and confirmation of improvement in model fit via BIC and the ACF plots), the random effects (i.e. for each subcatchment) from this model were used as the response variable in the subcatchment analyses as described below.\\n\\n# Spatial Model of Soil Type, Sheep and Cattle Stocking Rates on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nThe random effects from the best temporal model quantify differences between the subcatchments in population-adjusted Campylobacter case rates which are not explained by the hydrology, temperature, evapotranspiration or rainfall. These spatial differences between the subcatchments might be due to other environmental factors, in particular soil type and livestock grazing.\\n\\nSoil data from the Soil Survey of England and Wales (SSEW) maps for northern England at 100-m grid resolution were analysed at the level of the soil group in the SSEW classification. Different soil groups show strong collinearity, and it was not practical to include all the soil groups (plus interactions with livestock) as explanatory variables.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacter Case Study\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n\\n# International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 0, No. 0\\n\\n(a) Total number of Campylobacter cases per 1000 population in each subcatchment over whole study period; (b) elevation above sea level in metres.\\n\\n# Variables in the Subcatchment Models\\n\\nTo identify the main patterns of variation in the composition of SSEW soil groups across the subcatchments, the matrix of subcatchments by soil groups was initially analysed using principal components analysis (PCA). The subcatchments by soil groups matrix was Hellinger-transformed before the PCA analysis, as the total areas of each soil group within a subcatchment were non-independent. The soil type(s) with the highest correlations with PC1 (and if necessary PC2) were used as predictors in the linear models.\\n\\nData on the numbers of livestock derived from the Defra Agricultural Census (2010); these were obtained at 2-km grid resolution. Total numbers of sheep/km2 and cattle/km2 were calculated within GRASS for each subcatchment. There is evidence that sheep and cattle may play slightly different roles in the transmission of Campylobacter to humans; therefore they were used as separate predictor variables in the subcatchment analyses.\\n\\nThe linear models used the random effects from the temporal analyses as the response, with explanatory variables of sheep/km2, cattle/km2, and the soil type(s) most characteristic of variation between the subcatchments. All main effects and higher-level interactions were initially fitted to the full linear model, which was simplified until a minimal model with lowest BIC was identified.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Hydrological Model\\n\\n# Characteristics of Subcatchments\\n\\nThe distributions of the 30 subcatchments are summarized in Figure 2b. The geographical extent of some subcatchments was unchanged irrespective of the number of subcatchments used to subdivide the whole Tyne catchment. These were generally subcatchments in the upland reaches of the Tyne catchment, where the topography was such that there was considerable difference in elevation from river valley to mountain tops, with the result that subcatchments could be clearly defined hydrologically, e.g. the Rede Valley, West and East Allendales: subcatchments 2, 26 and 27, respectively.\\n\\nIn contrast, where the topography was flatter, there was more variation in subcatchment area and shape depending on whether 20, 30 or 40 subcatchments were used, e.g. subcatchments 14, 18, 19 and 22 around Tyneside. Highest Campylobacter case rates per head of population were in the Allendales and east of the catchment near Tyneside (Figure 3a). Irrespective of the number of subcatchments used, those in the north-west and south-west of the Tyne catchment were predominantly upland, with higher livestock numbers, compared with the lowland and urbanized eastern end of the catchment (Figure 3b). Soils in the Tyne catchment as a whole are dominated by gley soils with a high clay content, raw peats in the uplands and brown earths on some of the better low-altitude agricultural land (Table 1).\\n\\n# Topmodel Hydrological Model\\n\\nTemperature and rainfall showed strong cyclical patterns on an annual basis, as might be expected, with knock-on effects on predicted evapotranspiration across the whole Tyne region. The saturated overland flow, qo, was less predictable, with large overland flow predicted by Topmodel during the winter of 2006–07. This was associated with a period of intense rainfall, but there were considerable variations between subcatchments in predicted overland flow as a result of between-subcatchment variation in temperature, rainfall and topography. For example, peak overland flow was very high in the south-west of the Tyne catchment in winter 2006–07, particularly around the River West Allen and East Allen, and River South Tyne near.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - International Journal of Epidemiology\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ccc;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 0, No. 0\\n\\nFigure 4.

CCF values were lowest for the River Derwent (NRFA station 23007) and Team Valley (NRFA station 23017), both of which are lowland catchments that only partially encompass some of the subcatchments we defined for use in Topmodel and include relatively large urban areas. The highest time lag was 7 days recorded for the North Tyne (NRFA station 23022), but the NRFA warn that flow records from this gauging station are strongly affected by Kielder Reservoir, which is important for human-induced water discharge.\\n\\n# Temporal Model of Effects on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nThe population-adjusted case rate was most strongly associated with overland surface-water flow, temperature and the interactions between overland flow and temperature, and between evapotranspiration and rain (Table 3), with case rates predicted to be higher with increased overland flow and in warm weather conditions. There was a spring peak in Campylobacter cases every year in the most densely populated subcatchments around Newcastle and Tynemouth (numbers 14, 17, 18, 19 and 22; Figure 2), but seasonal patterns were less consistent across all years of the study in the other subcatchments.\\n\\nThe minimal linear mixed-effects model showed strong residual autocorrelation, evident at lags 2 and 3 in particular, with an optimum ARMA model at lag p = 3 and moving average q = 2. The need for ARMA models could simply reflect time delays between Campylobacter infection and sample date, since the onset of disease post-exposure is variable (see Discussion). Examination of residuals indicated that the model fitted best to the catchments in the north-west of the Tyne catchment, and most poorly in the south and east of the catchment, especially some of the flatter, lowland urban areas, where it is possible that subcatchment area and extents were less accurately defined, or where the epidemiology of the disease was different.\\n\\n# Spatial Model of Soil Type and Livestock Impact\\n\\nOver 60% of the variation in the composition of SSEW soil groups within each subcatchment was explained by the first PCA axis, which represented a trend from stagnohumic gleys and raw peats through to brown earths and stagnogleys. PCA axis 1 was most strongly positively correlated with the stagnogleys (r = 0.906, P < 0.0001); therefore the area of stagnogley in each subcatchment was used as an explanatory variable in subsequent analyses. In contrast, PCA axis 2 only explained 15% of the variation in SSEW soil composition, was not clearly associated with...\\n---\\n# Research Paper - International Journal of Epidemiology\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# International Journal of Epidemiology\\n\\n# 2017, Vol. 0, No. 0\\n\\nFigure 5.

We assumed that the random effects from the best temporal model described above quantified the unexplained spatial variation across different subcatchments in the population-adjusted Campylobacter case rate. The subcatchment (linear) models used these random effects as response variables, to determine which environmental variables at the subcatchment level were most associated with deviations from the ‘average’ effect explained by the fixed effects of the temporal model.\\n\\nThe amount of stagnogley, cattle density and interactions between the stagnogleys x cattle and sheep x cattle, were found to be the most important environmental variables of the random intercepts in the best subcatchment model (F5,24 = 17.39, Adj-R2 = 0.739, P < 0.0001; Table 4). The signs on the estimated coefficient values in Table 4 indicate that deviations from the predicted case rate from the temporal model were negative for individual subcatchments with larger areas of stagnogley (Figure 6b) and areas of higher numbers of cattle (mid-altitude: Figure 5b).\\n\\nHowever, the positive cattle x stagnogley interaction (Table 4; t = 2.334, P = 0.0283) suggests that in those subcatchments that contained large cattle numbers grazing stagnogley soils, the temporal model under-predicted Campylobacter case rate. Sheep grazing without cattle was mainly associated with the uplands (excluding the north-west around Kielder Forest), but the positive cattle x sheep interaction (Table 4; t = 2.958, P = 0.0069) suggests higher Campylobacter case rates in those (predominantly lower altitude) subcatchments which contained both sheep and cattle grazing.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThis study has identified associations between population-adjusted Campylobacter case rates and landscape hydrology, land use, and meteorology. Meteorological conditions were important over the 63-month study period, with higher Campylobacter case rates associated with higher temperatures and periods of high surface-water overland flow. Subcatchment hydrology was affected by both the weather conditions and topology of each subcatchment. Periods of high surface-water overland flow, in those subcatchments where the topography resulted in increased flow rates, were significant.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - International Journal of Epidemiology\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-weight: bold;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# International Journal of Epidemiology\\n\\n2017, Vol. 0, No. 0\\n\\n# Table 2.

Human behavior may play a role in this peak, with larger numbers of visits to the countryside in the spring.\\n\\nThe subcatchment analyses provide insights into spatial processes that affect Campylobacter case rates, after adjusting for weather-related temporal changes over the study period. Stagnogleys are clay soils prone to waterlogging during heavy rain. The negative main-effect coefficient for stagnogleys indicates that Campylobacter cases were generally lower in those subcatchments, but only if the effects of livestock grazing are ignored.\\n\\nConversely, raw peats and stagnohumic gley were strongly negatively correlated with soil PCA Axis 1; if either are used instead of stagnogley as the soil predictor in the subcatchment analyses, they are associated with increased Campylobacter cases. Soil-borne pathogens survive better in a more open soil matrix that allows increased penetration into the soil and contains more organic matter, with reduced desiccation during dry weather.\\n\\nSubcatchments with high numbers of cattle were associated with decreased Campylobacter case rates, in contrast to the findings of most previous studies. The decrease in Campylobacter case rates with cattle may result from people being less likely to cross fields stocked by cattle or avoidance of slurry-treated areas and dung-pats.\\n\\nStagnogley soils are vulnerable to poaching by livestock, especially in wet weather, and this can be exacerbated by spatial clustering of livestock within fields. Poaching will lead to reduced infiltration of water into the soil but will lead to increased surface-water flow. Higher rates of Campylobacter contamination have been recorded on clay soils such as stagnogleys.\\n\\nOur results accord with earlier studies, with cattle grazing on stagnogley soils being associated with higher Campylobacter case rates. Higher Campylobacter case rates also occurred in subcatchments with both sheep and cattle. While both sheep and cattle are known to be excretors of Campylobacter, our results suggest that cattle are more important.\\n\\nRun-off water from sheep and cattle-grazed agricultural land, eventually entering the groundwater drinking supply, has also been identified as a source of human Campylobacter infections.\\n\\nThere have been few attempts to investigate pathogen spread at the catchment scale, with some of the most detailed single studies being undertaken in Australia and New Zealand under different climatic and agricultural systems from those in the UK.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - International Journal of Epidemiology\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.acknowledgements, .funding, .conflict-of-interest {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nmargin: 5px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# International Journal of Epidemiology, 2017, Vol. 0, No. 0'),\n",

It is nevertheless clear that the environment has a major role, but the main limitation of this study was that it was not possible to quantify the relative importance of environmental versus food-borne sources of infection. Another challenge is the delay between infection and reporting of cases, which may partly explain the need to use ARMA models; delays from onset of infection to receipt of specimen are on average 5 days in England and Wales but is typically 16 days in Scotland, based on data collected from 1989 to 1999. Nevertheless, our calculated lag times are slightly less than might be expected a priori. In Campylobacter the incubation period is usually 2–5 days before symptoms arise; and in our data where a doctor could provide an onset date, the median was 4 days, giving an overall delay between infection and specimen of 6 to 9 days. This compares lags of 2 to 3 days for our ARMA model. The types of analyses we describe would become much more powerful, and useful for public health, if we had had data on the strain types (ST) of the individual human Campylobacter infections, plus samples of Campylobacter taken from the countryside and livestock. Powerful Bayesian methods have recently been developed to source-attribute models, using ST data. This would permit a formal link of source to humans, particularly as our results suggest the infection sources change over time and that the risks to human health also depend on human behaviour and activity in the wider countryside.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank other ENIGMA Consortium investigators for advice on this research, including Rob Christley, Christiane Hertz-Fowler, Paul Wigley, Nicola Williams and Craig Winstanley (University of Liverpool), Peter Diggle (Lancaster University), Iain Lake (University of East Anglia), Ken Forbes and Norval Strachan (University of Aberdeen), Rachel Grith and Dan Rigby (University of Manchester), Paul Cross (Bangor University), Tom Humphrey (Swansea University), Malcolm Bennett (University of Nottingham), David Howard (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) and Brendan Wren (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine).\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nThis work was supported by the Medical Research Council Grant, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Economic & Social Research Council, the Biotechnology & Biological Sciences Research Council and the Food Standards Agency through the Environmental & Social Ecology of Human Infectious Diseases Initiative (ENIGMA Consortium—study of Campylobacter project: grant reference G1100799/1).\\n\\n# Conflict of Interest\\n\\nNone declared.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

Campylobacteriosis incidence exhibits seasonality and has been attributed to ambient temperature. However, the role of ambient temperature on campylobacteriosis remains poorly understood. To examine the impact of ambient temperature on local campylobacteriosis in Germany, weekly incidences on NUTS-3 level were analysed using a novel small-scaled approach, regression and time lags. Campylobacteriosis incidence correlated positively with temperatures between −5 and 28 °C. The sigmoid regression model estimated an incidence increase of 0.52 per 5 °C temperature rise in the observation period. The weekly average of daily minimum temperature was most significant at a time lag of two weeks and showed the steepest incidence increase of 0.13 per 1 °C temperature increase in a temperature corridor of 5.1 to 12.2 °C. The impact of average minimum temperatures on campylobacteriosis incidence is crucial, likely to be indirect and especially relevant in the recent part of the infection chain. Vectors or human behaviour are presumably more directly linked with temperature than the pathogen’s microbiology and should be examined. These variables outweigh the direct temperature-pathogen relationship when the whole chain of infection is considered. In the context of climate change, campylobacteriosis is likely to increase in Germany due to an increased temperature effect.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter spp. is one of the leading bacterial causes for human gastroenteritis worldwide. In Germany, campylobacteriosis represents the most common cause of bacterial foodborne illness, and cases show a continuous upward trend from 2005 onwards. With 67,872 cases in 2018, Germany has now become the EU country with the highest case numbers. Among several known pathogenic subspecies, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the most commonly associated subspecies for human campylobacteriosis. The transmission route of Campylobacter spp. is mainly believed to be foodborne, via the consumption of undercooked meat and meat products, as well as unpasteurised milk or contaminated drinking water, fruit and vegetables. A proportion of cases occur following contact with domestic animals, working or living on a farm, travelling or frequent eating out at restaurants. Further potential sources of infection identified include interacting with water bodies, such as rivers and surface waters during recreational activities. Vectors, such as flies or litter beetles have been discussed as transmission vehicles on farms as well as at food preparation level. The relative proportion of each of the named sources and transmission routes to the total burden of disease is unknown. However, the consumption of contaminated poultry is believed to be a major transmission route. Contamination of broiler flocks mainly occurs through contact with faeces during slaughter, resulting in 30 to 54% of all carcasses in Germany found to be Campylobacter-positive. The success of Campylobacter spp. transmission is closely related to its bacterial fitness. Campylobacter spp. is thermophilic and microaerophilic, replicating at an optimum growth temperature of 42 °C and in an environment of 5% of oxygen. These conditions have been interpreted as an adaptation to its major habitat, the gastrointestinal tracts of warm-blooded avians. Due to its thermophilic character replication outside the host as well as at ambient temperatures is unlikely. Despite this, Campylobacter spp. can survive over a wide range of temperatures and climatic conditions for an extended period. Its genotype determines campylobacters’ fitness in the host and a range of environmental conditions. For protection against adverse atmospheric conditions and to create a microaerophilic habitat, Campylobacter spp. forms biofilms.\\n\\nScientific Reports | (2020) 10:17191 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73865-9\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis and Temperature\\n\\n#\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis and Temperature\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the relationship between temperature and the incidence of campylobacteriosis in Germany over a 14-year period. The findings suggest a significant correlation between temperature fluctuations and the seasonal patterns of campylobacteriosis cases.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacter spp. are known to produce various antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (KatA). In response to heat stress, these bacteria produce heat shock proteins, which may explain their optimal growth temperature. Under temperature stress, Campylobacter spp. can transform from a spiral shape into a coccoid form, although the implications of this transformation on resistance remain debated.\\n\\nIn Germany, the incidence of campylobacteriosis exhibits a seasonal pattern, peaking in summer and early January. Similar patterns have been observed in other temperate climates, including Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, and New Zealand. Previous studies have indicated a linear relationship between temperature increases and campylobacteriosis cases, although some studies found no significant association.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Epidemiological Data\\n\\nData on campylobacteriosis cases were obtained from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for the years 2001 to 2014, covering 730 weeks. The data includes various case definitions and is reported at the NUTS-3 level, which encompasses 413 reporting areas across Germany.\\n\\n# Weather Data\\n\\nTemperature data from 2000 to 2014 was sourced from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset project. The data was processed to focus on Germany, ensuring compatibility with the epidemiological data.\\n\\n# GIS Data\\n\\nGIS shapefiles were utilized to provide spatial information for reporting area-based incidence values. The data was enhanced for the Berlin area to ensure higher spatial resolution.\\n\\n# Data Processing\\n\\nWeather and incidence data were harmonized for spatial and temporal compatibility. Temperature data was aggregated to a weekly resolution, and various statistical methods were employed to analyze the relationship between temperature and campylobacteriosis incidence.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe analysis revealed a strong association between temperature and the incidence of campylobacteriosis, supporting the hypothesis that temperature is a primary driver of seasonal patterns in infection rates.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the seasonality of campylobacteriosis. Further research is needed to explore the specific environmental and biological factors that influence this relationship.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis study provides evidence of the influence of temperature on campylobacteriosis incidence in Germany, highlighting the importance of monitoring environmental factors in public health strategies.\\n\\n&copy; 2023 Research on Campylobacteriosis and Temperature.

SSDA quantifies the influence of the tested temperature parameter on the incidence outcome.\\n\\nThe expected incidence is calculated as follows:\\n\\nexpected incidence = Ni(k)/N∑ (k=1)\\n\\nwhere Ni(k) is the incidence value and N is the total number of incidence entries.\\n\\nTo examine temporal patterns, R-square and SSDA results were plotted, linking lagtypes per temperature parameter to show the temporal evolution of the association.\\n\\nExtreme classes (class 1 and 61) were omitted to avoid skewed results due to unequal class entries and broader class widths.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nA statistically significant association was found between local ambient temperature and campylobacteriosis incidence. All sigmoid regressions explained more than 97% of the variation in incidence outcome, with R-square values ranging from 0.9715 to 0.9959 (mean = 0.99).\\n\\nThe SSDA ranged from 7.9291 to 12.4871 (mean = 10.8995) across all temperature parameters and lagtypes. The steepest gradient for all temperature parameters averaged 0.1 (SD(m) = 0.01), indicating that a 5 °C increase in temperature is associated with an incidence increase of 0.52 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week.\\n\\nFor more information, visit Nature Scientific Reports.\\n---\\n# Campylobacteriosis Incidence and Temperature\\n\\n#\\n# Campylobacteriosis Incidence and Temperature\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports | DOI: 10.1038/s41598-020-73865-9\\n\\n# Temperature Parameters and Incidence\\n\\nFigure 3 illustrates a scatterplot of all temperature parameters in lagtype 1, produced using Tableau Desktop (Version 2019.4.0).\\n\\nWithin a temperature corridor of −5 °C to 28 °C, incidence increased with rising ambient temperature. Below and above this corridor, incidence did not significantly alter with changing temperature. The temperature parameter with the absolute maximum incidence of 2.25 was reached at the weekly average of daily minimum temperature (Tmin_avg) in lagtype 1, with a median temperature of 13.91 °C and a temperature range of −7.2 °C to 15.9 °C. Most incidence changes occurred between 0 to 12 °C.\\n\\nHighest SSDA values were reached for minimum and mean temperatures in lagtype 2.\\n\\n# Thresholds and Regression Analysis\\n\\nThe extended evaluation of selected parameters showed different thresholds across the segmented regression. Among the temperature parameters in lagtype 2, the lowest threshold was reached at 0.53 °C mean temperature, whereas the highest upper threshold was reached at a mean temperature of 27.02 °C. The inclination of the first regression segment of each parameter shows a very shallow increase of 0.03. From the lower to the upper threshold, a steeper increase of 0.08 to 0.13 can be observed. From the upper threshold, a slightly negative to a shallow positive inclination of −0.02 to 0.02 is reached.\\n\\nAt the weekly average of daily minimum temperature between 5.1 to 12.2 °C, the steepest incidence increase can be observed with 0.13 per 1 °C temperature increase. Above the upper threshold, incidence gradually declines.\\n\\nThe correlation via plotted R-square and SSDA values showed an evolution along lagtype 1 to 8 for all temperature parameters. The correlation was maximal in lagtype 4 and 5 at weekly mean and maximum temperature parameters, and for weekly minimum temperature parameters, an offset of two weeks was most significant.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe small-scaled approach found robust evidence of a positive correlation between local campylobacteriosis incidence and local temperature in Germany, reproducing the correlation found at low resolutions in previous studies. The strength of the association and the identification of significant lagtypes provide evidence for the influence of ambient temperature on campylobacteriosis.\\n\\nThe described temperature corridor where incidence alters with changing temperature has been observed in previous studies. The parallelism of the segmented linear regressions and inclinations across the whole observed temperature range underlines the described association between campylobacteriosis and ambient temperature and underpins the robustness of the model.\\n\\nIn the context of climate change, days with warmer minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures will become more frequent in Germany. Therefore, an increased temperature effect on campylobacteriosis incidence can be expected in the future.\\n\\nThe identified upper-temperature threshold with a maximum incidence of approximately 2.2 among all temperature parameters could be explained by non-climatic parameters which stabilize incidence at this level. At the upper threshold, the influential factors resulting in the observed incidence have unfolded their full temperature-associated infectious potential. Stabilizing factors of campylobacteriosis incidence may include hygiene standards in food production, public awareness, and socio-economic conditions related to adequate food handling and dietary habits specific to Germany.\\n\\n© 2020 Scientific Reports\\n---\\n# Campylobacteriosis Incidence and Temperature\\n\\n#\\n# Campylobacteriosis Incidence and Temperature\\n\\n# Temperature Parameters and Incidence\\n\\nFigure 4 illustrates the sigmoid regression of significant temperature parameters selected by maximum SSDA values in lagtype 2.

However, the positive correlation between incidence and temperature cannot be explained by the microbiology of campylobacters solely. Increasing temperatures, especially between 5 and 25 °C, lead to increased inactivation of Campylobacter in vitro, while their survival is prolonged at cold temperatures. These findings are contradictory to the observed relationship of our study. However, it can explain the higher incidence at average minimum temperatures.\\n\\nThe discrepancy between Campylobacter microbiology and campylobacteriosis incidence in increasing temperature conditions remains and leads to the conclusion that the weather-sensitive mechanisms on campylobacteriosis must lie outside the direct weather-pathogen relationship. These factors, themselves temperature-sensitive, are assumed to be the driving force in human campylobacteriosis at increasing temperature, outweighing the direct relationship between pathogen and temperature when the whole chain of infection is considered.\\n\\nIn addition to temperature, other climatic factors have been related to campylobacteriosis, such as precipitation and UV-radiation. Inconsistent evidence exists on the association between precipitation and campylobacteriosis incidence. Some studies found conflicting results or no significant association between campylobacteriosis and precipitation. Other authors suggest heavy rain events as well as very low rainfall of 20 mm and below per week to be associated with an increased risk of campylobacteriosis, especially in campylobacteriosis outbreaks due to contaminated drinking water.\\n\\nRechenburg and Kistemann showed that elevated bacterial river contamination coincides with heavy rain events in summer. These contaminated surface waters may become a health risk when used for recreational purposes or irrigation of cultivated plants.\\n\\nSupplementary information available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73865-9.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Temperature and Campylobacter Seasonality\\n\\n#\\n# Temperature and Campylobacter Seasonality\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports | (2020) 10:17191 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73865-9\\n\\n# Figures and Data Analysis\\n\\nFigure 7.

These graphs were plotted using RStudio (Version 1.0.153, URL: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/older-versions/).\\n\\nThe steep increase of the weekly median of daily maximum precipitation may explain the asymmetric nature of the Campylobacter seasonality seen in Figure 8. Increased UV-radiation and coinciding higher temperatures were associated with a decline of Campylobacter rates, but the best performing models included temperature as a confounding variable.\\n\\nDespite climatic factors, various non-climatic temperature-sensitive drivers of human campylobacteriosis have been suggested. Campylobacter spp. is more prevalent from spring to autumn in food-producing animals such as poultry, when ambient temperatures show a seasonal increase. However, findings from several studies indicate that the seasonal increase of campylobacters in chicken does not always precede the peak of human cases.\\n\\n© 2020 Scientific Reports.

The relationship between human campylobacteriosis and ambient temperature is supported by various studies.\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns\\n\\nThe seasonal rise of human campylobacteriosis has been linked to a higher prevalence of vectors, such as flies, which can contaminate broiler flocks. Studies indicate that the installation of fly screens in broiler houses reduces the prevalence of Campylobacter spp.\\n\\n# Temperature and Human Behavior\\n\\nHuman behavior is highly sensitive to weather, influencing outdoor activities and agricultural practices.

The influence of temperature on human campylobacteriosis is likely to be indirect and especially relevant in the recent part of the infection chain. We suggest that campylobacteriosis incidence is not the result of a single driver but the integral of multiple climatic and non-climatic factors.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIt was demonstrated that incidence strongly associates with the average minimum temperatures two weeks before. The results indicate that average minimum temperatures are especially relevant in the recent part of the chain of infection. Along the food chain, this period includes slaughter, transport, food storage, processing, and consumption.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nA short delay provides evidence for a possible causal relationship between local ambient temperature and campylobacteriosis outcome. We suggest that the identified temperature ranges encourage risky human (diet) behaviour and subsequently lead to an increase in campylobacteriosis incidence. Consequently, human (diet) behaviour in the context of foodborne diseases is a crucial target for mitigation strategies.\\n\\nAlthough statements can only be derived from the observation period, an increase in campylobacteriosis incidence is likely with projected warmer temperatures in the context of climate change.\\n\\n# References'),\n",

Furthermore, we determined the correlation between these factors and various climatic factors, including wind-chill temperature, relative humidity, rate of sunshine, and particulate matter. Rotavirus A infections occurred frequently in February, March, and April on an annual basis. Furthermore, during the study, the detection rate was highest at 17.0% (n=61/359) in 2011. Based on an analysis of weather big data, patient age, and period-specific infection during the summer, when the wind-chill temperature and relative humidity were high, the Rotavirus A infection rate was very low. Relative humidity (p=0.020) and particulate matter (p=0.049) were associated with the average number of monthly cases of Rotavirus A infection. However, wind chill temperature (p=0.074) and rate of sunshine (p=0.993) were not associated with the average monthly distribution of Rotavirus A cases. These results indicate that Rotavirus A infection was correlated with relative humidity and particulate matter during the study period and further the current understanding of the distribution of Rotavirus A infections resulting from climatic factors and particulate matter. This could help establish climate-related health policies to reduce the incidence of diarrhea and guide the development of vaccines against Rotavirus A.\\n\\nKeywords: Climate, Diarrhea-causing virus, Infection, Relative humidity, Rotavirus A, Particulate matter\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nGastritis accompanied by diarrhea affects approximately 3–5 billion individuals worldwide each year, with approximately 2 million deaths reported worldwide (Park et al. 2019). For children under 5 years of age, severe diarrhea often requires hospitalization, resulting in productivity and economic losses for families from hospitalization and outpatient treatment (Lee and Yang 2017; Park et al. 2019). Although the number of deaths from diarrhea-viral gastritis in developed countries is steadily decreasing owing to improved hygiene and lifestyles, the incidence and mortality rates of gastritis in developing countries are still high (Kim and Kim 2014). Diarrhea caused by gastritis is a major public health concern worldwide and accounts for a large proportion of mortality (Ghazani et al. 2018; Ouedraogo et al. 2017). The pathogens causing diarrhea with viral gastroenteritis include astrovirus, adenovirus, Rotavirus A, and norovirus (Kim and Chung 2020; Kim and Kim 2014). Rotavirus A is the most common and major pathogen worldwide, causing severe diarrhea among infants under 5 years of age (Lee and Yang 2017). Rotavirus A belongs to the family Reoviridae and is classified into 10 groups, labeled A–J, depending on the surface antigen (Kim et al. 1992; Kim and Chung 2020).\\n\\nRotavirus A is also an important cause of diarrhea in older people (GBD 2016 Diarrhoeal Disease Collaborators). High Rotavirus A vaccine efficacy (85 to 98%) has been observed in the USA, Latin America, and Europe. In Korea, the Rotatech® vaccine was introduced as a licensed vaccine in June 2007, reducing the hospitalization and infection rates.\\n\\nCorresponding Author: Jae Kyung Kim\\n\\n1 Department of Medical Laser, Dankook University Graduate School of Medicine, 119, Dandae-ro, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan-si, Chungnam 31116, South Korea\\n\\n2 Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science, Dankook University College of Health Sciences, 119, Dandae-ro, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan-si, Chungnam 31116, South Korea\\n\\nPublished online: 13 April 2021\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus A Infection Rates\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 30px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus A Infection Rates and Climatic Factors\\n\\n(Yoon et al. 2018). In general, however, the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea increases significantly with a deterioration in air quality, and long-term air pollution can further increase the incidence of rotavirus diseases (Ye et al. 2016). In this study, we retrospectively analyzed Rotavirus A infection rates and big data from the Korea Meteorological Administration to determine whether particular climatic factors and particulate matter affected Rotavirus A infection rates over an almost 10-year span from June 2010 to December 2019, in Cheonan, Korea. This study provides useful data to guide the establishment of health policies for controlling viral diarrhea diseases, including Rotavirus A diseases, and the development of anti-viral vaccines.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Patient Information\\n\\nThis retrospective study examined the results of multiplex reverse transcription PCR (mRT-PCR) analysis of 4009 fecal samples collected between June 2010 and December 2019. The samples were provided by 4009 in-patients who were asked to test for diarrhea owing to suspected gastrointestinal diseases at Dankook University Hospital, Cheonan, Korea. The samples were obtained within 24 h of hospitalization. Data regarding the age and sex of the study participants were retrieved from patient records. Owing to the retrospective nature of the study and the varying time before each patient visited the hospital after becoming ill, information on the viral incubation period could not be collected. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dankook University (approval number 2019-12-007), and it was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration. The notation of viruses is according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 2019.\\n\\n# Climatic Variables\\n\\nThe Cheonan region of Chungcheongnam-do, Korea, is an area of 636.3 km2 with a typical temperate climate owing to its location at 36.47° N and 127.13° E. The climatic variables examined in the study were the month, day, year, daily temperature, wind-chill temperature, average monthly temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, rate of sunshine, atmospheric pressure, and particulate matter. ASOS is the manual weather measurement system of the Korea Meteorological Administration dedicated to weather factor observation, and weather information obtained from ASOS is recognized by the Korea Meteorological Administration. The wind-chill temperature was determined using the formula provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration as follows:\\n\\nWind-chill temperature = 13.12 + 0.6215 × T − 11.37V0.16 + 0.3965V0.16x,\\n\\nwhere T is the air temperature (°C), and V is the wind speed (km/h) measured at a height of 10 m above ground.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nSAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), was used for descriptive statistical analysis, frequency analysis, and binomial logistic-regression analysis to investigate the associations between meteorological data and particulate matter concentrations with Rotavirus A infection rates.

The Cesa3 gene of Arabidopsis was used as the internal control, whereas the negative control was distilled water. The mRT-PCR products were subjected to agarose gel (2%) electrophoresis at 100 V for 30 min, and the results were analyzed.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Rotavirus A Infection by Age\\n\\nIn total, 4009 inpatients were tested for Rotavirus A infections between June 2010 and December 2019, with 419 (10.5%) patients testing positive. The highest Rotavirus A infection rate, 48.2% (202/419), was observed in patients aged below 1 year, followed by that in patients aged 1–3 years at 33.4% (140/419; Table 1). No cases of infection (0/419) were observed in patients 30–39, 50–59, and ≥80 years of age. A distinct infection pattern was observed in different age groups.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus A Infection Rates\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus A Infection Rates\\n\\n# Age and Sex Distribution of Detected Cases of Rotavirus A\\n\\n|Age|Cases (n=419)|%|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Under 1|202|48.2%|\\n|1~3|140|33.4%|\\n|3~5|38|9.1%|\\n|5~7|21|5.0%|\\n|7~10|10|2.4%|\\n|10~19|4|1.0%|\\n|20~29|1|0.2%|\\n|30~39|0|0.0%|\\n|40~49|1|0.2%|\\n|50~59|0|0.0%|\\n|60~69|1|0.2%|\\n|70~79|1|0.2%|\\n|80~89|0|0.0%|\\n|≥90|0|0.0%|\\n\\n# Sex Distribution of Detected Cases of Rotavirus A\\n\\n|Sex|Cases|%|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Male|229|54.7%|\\n|Female|190|45.3%|\\n\\n# Rotavirus A Infection by Year\\n\\nIn terms of the annual Rotavirus A infection rate from June 2010 to December 2019, Rotavirus A peaked in 2015 but tended to decrease over the years.

Confidence interval (CI) was the statistical estimate obtained from the observed data.\\n\\nBetween 2010 and 2019, the Rotavirus A infection rate peaked in 2015, decreasing thereafter each year. Since the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in 2007, the Rotavirus A infection rate has gradually decreased, and since 2010, this rate has decreased drastically in the Republic of Korea (Kim and Chung 2020). However, long-term monitoring of the rotavirus vaccine and the Rotavirus A infection rate is needed.\\n\\nRotavirus A infections have a high worldwide prevalence, occurring throughout the year in tropical regions but occurring less frequently and only in cold, dry climates, and in hot, humid climates in temperate regions (Ghazani et al. 2018). In this study, we retrospectively analyzed Rotavirus A infection rates and big data from the Korea Meteorological Administration to determine whether particular climatic factors and particulate matter affect Rotavirus A infection. This study identified the largest distribution in November 2010. In March 2011, 2012, and 2013, the distribution peaked in April. Again, the distribution peaked in December 2014 and February 2015. In 2016, it occurred most frequently in March and May, followed by February, March, and April from 2017 to 2018. Concurrent with results of other reports (Lee et al. 2018), these results indicate that Rotavirus A infections occurred in spring, fall, and winter, but not in summer months. As the living environment improves, the penetration rate of heating and cooling facilities such as air conditioners and boilers increases, which is likely to cause diarrhea, especially among infants, students, and the elderly who spend most of their time indoors (Goh et al. 2019).\\n\\nFurthermore, Rotavirus A infection in neonates is an important cause of enteritis in maternity wards (Totterdell et al. 1976). Moreover, temperature and humidity in the surrounding hospital environment can affect the survival of the virus, which in turn can affect the spread of the infection (Hall 2007; Karim et al. 1985; Kim et al. 2018; Miller and Artenstein 1967). In particular, Rotavirus A is primarily transmitted through the feco-oral route and through airborne transmission, contaminated food, or the respiratory system (Lee et al. 2019). It is not clear how environmental factors specifically affect the virus; however, studies on preventive medicine approaches are currently underway in numerous countries to assess the prevalence of diarrhea-causing viruses and their association with climatic factors. Laboratory monitoring of gastrointestinal inflammation with diarrhea has been previously performed for other diseases, and monitoring of gastrointestinal inflammation with diarrhea is currently in place in numerous countries (Ghazani et al. 2018; Ouedraogo et al. 2017; Yen et al. 2020). Moe and Shirley (1982) reported that Rotavirus A is highly stable at high or low humidity but unstable at moderate humidity. Furthermore, they reported that during dry periods with low humidity and temperature, the virus can survive on household objects for up to 1 week. These findings indicate that several environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, and rainfall, are associated with the occurrence of Rotavirus A infections.\\n\\nSince the incubation period for Rotavirus A is between 48 and 72 h, virus transmissions are highest in the early stages of an outbreak and low after 8 days; thus, it is important to test for the virus early and repeatedly (Davidson et al. 1975). Goh et al. (2019) studied changes in the association between the infection rate of pathogens causing acute diarrhea in Daegu and climatic factors and reported intensive levels of viral pathogens in cold, humid winter months, with some changes in general patterns. Rotavirus A infection rates are higher in cold, dry weather conditions (Wang et al. 2018). At low temperatures, pathogens are more stable and more likely to interact with air, food, and water (Ye et al. 2016). In the current study, the correlation between Rotavirus A infection and climatic factors indicated that relative humidity was significantly associated with Rotavirus A infection and that temperature and rate of sunshine were not significantly related. The concentration of particulate matter, an important pollutant and factor associated with climate change, has received increasing attention, especially its association with respiratory diseases (Riechelmann et al. 2003; Ye et al. 2016). However, studies on the role of particulate matter and digestive diseases have not reported significant results. Cao et al. (2014) described one possibility in their latest study; they reported that PM2.5 and PM10 particles harbor abundant microorganisms from the environment, including various types of viruses. Consequently, rotavirus in the excreta of infected patients and in the external environment, such as water and soil, can be transmitted through attachment to PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles (Ye et al. 2016). A previous study reported that particulate matter concentration is associated with Rotavirus A infections. Concurrently, this study showed that particulate matter is associated with Rotavirus A infection rates, although the infection does not occur throughout the year in temperate regions. Furthermore, a study in China reported a positive correlation between the concentration of air pollutants, such as PM10, and morbidity due to rotavirus infections (Ye et al. 2016).\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus A Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 2em;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 1.5em;\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 1.2em;\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus A Infections\\n\\n# Limitations of the Study\\n\\nThis study has some limitations. First, a 10-year survey in a single city can be considered a relatively short-term evaluation. Therefore, our results might be biased in terms of viral dynamics. Second, because sample data were treated anonymously and patient residence was not specified, some of the test samples could have been provided by patients not residing in the study area. Therefore, owing to differences in geographical location among patients, differences in the seasonal distribution of Rotavirus A might have been observed in this study. Besides the pathogenic nature of viral infections, pathogenic infectious diseases are closely associated with geographical and climatic differences and socioeconomic factors (Liu et al. 2015, 2019). Furthermore, the prevalence of the virus could vary by country and region. Although most previous studies have reported that virus outbreaks are associated with low temperatures and dry climates, these findings might not apply to all countries and regions (Shamkhali Chenar and Deng 2017). Finally, the results reflect the trend in Rotavirus A infections since the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in Korea in 2007; however, the status of rotavirus vaccination has not been confirmed among the 4009 patients included in the study.\\n\\n# Findings and Implications'),\n",

In particular, the association between particulate matter concentration and Rotavirus A infection was confirmed, resulting from changes in climate factors such as wind-chill temperature, sunshine rate, and relative humidity, along with the serious health effects of an increase in the particulate matter concentration. We believe that the present results would facilitate assessments of vaccine efficacy and their establishment. Furthermore, by improving our understanding of the infection distribution of Rotavirus A owing to climate change, the establishment of health policies associated with viral diarrhea diseases and the development of further vaccines against Rotavirus A would be further facilitated. Further studies are required to assess environmental factors and regional effects on viral infectious diseases, along with further objective indicators of changes in the prevalence of diarrhea-causing viruses and preventive and management measures. We intend to further analyze big data, perform molecular investigations, and assess viral dynamics to achieve this.\\n\\n# Availability of Data and Materials\\n\\nThere are restrictions to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.

Rotavirus infection represents a significant burden of disease in developing countries, such as those in South Asia.\\n\\nMethods: We conducted a meta-analysis to examine how patterns of rotavirus infection relate to temperature and precipitation in South Asia. Monthly rotavirus data were abstracted from 39 published epidemiological studies and related to monthly aggregated ambient temperature and cumulative precipitation for each study location using linear mixed-effects models. We also considered associations with vegetation index, gathered from remote sensing data. Finally, we assessed whether the relationship varied in tropical climates and humid mid-latitude climates.\\n\\nResults: Overall, as well as in tropical and humid mid-latitude climates, low temperature and precipitation levels are significant predictors of an increased rate of rotaviral diarrhea. A 1°C decrease in monthly ambient temperature and a decrease of 10 mm in precipitation are associated with a 1.3% and 0.3% increase above the annual level in rotavirus infections, respectively. When assessing lagged relationships, temperature and precipitation in the previous month remained significant predictors and the association with temperature was stronger in the tropical climate. The same association was seen for vegetation index; a seasonal decline of 0.1 units results in a 3.8% increase in the rate of rotavirus.\\n\\nConclusions: In South Asia, the highest rate of rotavirus was seen in the colder, drier months. Meteorological characteristics can be used to better focus and target public health prevention programs.\\n\\n# Citation\\n\\nJagai JS, Sarkar R, Castronovo D, Kattula D, McEntee J, et al.

It has been estimated that the proportion of hospitalizations for childhood diarrhea due to rotavirus has increased from 22% to 39% from 1986 to 2004 [1] and for 2004 there were an estimated 527,000 rotavirus-related deaths annually worldwide [2]. Rotavirus is a common infection in children worldwide and it is estimated that by age 5 nearly every child will have an episode of rotavirus infection [3,4]. Children in developing countries, such as those in South Asia, bear the greatest burden of deaths, up to 82%, from rotavirus infection, primarily due to malnutrition or lack of access to rehydration therapy [3]. A recent review on the burden of rotavirus diarrhea estimated that rotavirus is responsible for the death of approximately 122,000–153,000 children annually in India alone [4]. As of 2006, there are two live oral vaccines which have undergone large scale clinical trials and are being introduced globally [5,6]. These vaccines may have a significant impact in developing countries. Increased understanding of the epidemiology and, in particular, seasonal patterns of rotavirus in these countries is needed to ensure effective vaccine intervention programs [6].\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org | May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e38168\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nul {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\npadding-left: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\nSeasonal fluctuations in infectious diseases, and specifically in rotavirus infection, are a well-known and well-documented phenomenon [7,8]. Rotavirus manifests at low endemic levels with pronounced seasonal outbreaks with considerable geographic variation. The virus is considered a winter disease with most cases observed in the coldest time of the year [7–9]. A review of 34 studies conducted worldwide found that rotavirus is more common in the cooler months in the temperate zones, yet the peak of disease can vary from autumn to spring [7]. The strong winter peak was seen primarily in the Americas, though in cities which cover various climates such as Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Houston, Texas, USA [7]. However in tropics (within 10N or 10S of the Equator) the pattern is less defined and autumn/spring peaks are more common [7]. A recent review considered the tropical region specifically and associated monthly disease incidence with meteorological variables for the same month. The analysis found that a 1°C increase in mean temperature resulted in a 10% decrease in rotavirus incidence and a 1 cm increase in mean monthly rainfall was associated with a 1% decrease in rotavirus incidence [8]. A review of 43 studies conducted in Africa found that rotavirus was detected year-round in nearly every country and generally exhibited distinct seasonal peaks during the dry months [10]. Another study of hospitalization for rotavirus which was conducted in three Australian cities found that admissions for rotavirus diarrhea peaked in winter and spring and was lowest in summer [11]. They also found that higher temperature and humidity in the previous week were associated with a decrease in rotavirus diarrheal admissions in all three cities [11].\\n\\nThe core of seasonality in infectious diseases is thought to be related to temporal oscillations in the governing transmission cycles of pathogenic agents and host susceptibility. Seasonal factors operate at many levels, creating temporal changes in human behavior, including sanitation and hygiene practices, and probability of environmental exposures [7,12–16]. Despite growing attention to disease seasonality, a solid theoretical underpinning for seasonal peaks is limited. Better insight into the nature of disease seasonality can be gained from understanding the association with meteorological and environmental drivers. With increasing monitoring of rotavirus worldwide [10,17], a more detailed documentation of seasonality will soon be available.'),\n",

Remote sensing data are primarily used to derive characteristics related to vegetation cover, landscape structure, and water content. The Vegetation Index (VI) is a measure of density of plant growth which is calculated from remote sensing data. Very low values of VI (0.1 and below) correspond to barren areas of rock, sand, or snow. Moderate values represent shrub and grassland (0.2 to 0.3), while high values indicate temperate and tropical rainforests (0.6 to 0.8). Measures of the VI have been used in previous epidemiological studies [18] and has demonstrated predictive properties for onchocerciasis in Ethiopia [19], schistosomiasis in Brazil [20], West Nile Virus in New York City [21], and cryptosporidiosis for specific climates in Africa [22].\\n\\nThe objective of this study is to increase the understanding of seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea and associations with meteorological characteristics in South Asia. We assembled a set of time series representing monthly rate of rotavirus from 39 studies conducted in South Asia and examined the relationships between disease rate and meteorological factors, namely precipitation and ambient temperature. We also consider the association between rate of rotavirus and vegetation index, a remote sensing measure of the combined effects of temperature and precipitation.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Outcome Data\\n\\nWe conducted a meta-analysis of studies published on rotavirus infection from 1966 to 2010 in South Asia, defined as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan. Literature was gathered using the Ovid MEDLINE search engine. The keywords used in the search were \"rotavirus infections\" or \"rotavirus.\" These keywords were combined with \"seasonality\" and \"seasons,\" resulting in 567 citations. The search was further narrowed by adding the keywords \"Asia,\" \"Asia Central,\" \"Asia Western,\" \"Asia Southeastern,\" resulting in a total of 152 citations after duplicate citations were removed. This database of studies was supplemented with references from review articles of rotavirus [7,8,16] and with studies from our own archives that included studies which do not appear in Ovid MEDLINE as they are published in South Asian scientific journals. This resulted in a total of 166 studies for evaluation. Studies were evaluated based on the following four criteria:\\n\\n- Studies must provide observational data on rotavirus in humans who are not immuno-compromised (i.e., HIV/AIDS patients);\\n- Studies must include at least a full year of data to cover all seasons;\\n- Studies must provide disease incidence or prevalence data on a daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation;\\n- Studies must provide data for a single location (i.e., hospital, village, etc).\\n\\nStudies which did not meet the criteria were excluded (Figure 1). A total of 40 studies met the study criteria of which 26 studies presented data in the published journal article (2 presented data on the same cohort; therefore the duplicate study was not included). We contacted the authors of 11 studies; 6 were able to provide data in the requested format. The remaining 8 studies provided monthly data aggregated over the entire study period. The final analysis comprised data from 39 studies. Data on rotavirus were aggregated on a monthly basis producing 47 time series, reflecting discrete time periods and locations (Table 1). Four studies provided data for more than one location or period of time.\\n\\n# Exposure Data: Temperature and Precipitation\\n\\nBased on the latitude and longitude of the study location for each time series, we supplemented monthly rotavirus data with time specific monthly mean ambient temperature and monthly cumulative precipitation, obtained from the National Climatic Data Center databases (792 of 1046 months = 75.7%). When meteorological data specific to the time of the study were unavailable (254 of 1046 months = 24.3%), normals for monthly average temperature and cumulative precipitation were gathered from Global Historical Climatology Network. Each study location was classified based on the Köppen Climate Classification [23]. Using the study locations’ latitude and longitude information each study location was superimposed on a map of Köppen Climate Classification and using a GIS spatial overlay each location was classified into a specific climate category. For the purposes of analysis we used only the four major classifications; moist tropical climates (Climate A), arid and semiarid climates (Climate B), humid mid-latitude areas (Climate C) and colder temperate areas (Climate D) (Figure 2).\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\n#\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\n# Literature Search Results\\n\\nTotal studies identified: N=166\\n\\n# Excluded Studies\\n\\n- No rotavirus: N = 32\\n- Review studies: N = 6\\n- Animal based studies: N = 3\\n- Outbreak investigation studies: N = 4\\n- Not complete year of study: N = 12\\n- Microbiology studies: N = 13\\n- Not in South Asia: N = 3\\n- Quarterly aggregation: N = 3\\n\\n# Studies which met criteria\\n\\nStudies included: N = 40\\n\\n# Studies without data in correct format\\n\\nStudies with data: N = 26\\n\\n# Studies with Author contact information\\n\\n- With contact: N = 11\\n- Without contact: N = 3\\n\\n# Studies with duplicate information\\n\\nUnique information: N = 25\\n\\n# Studies for which authors provided monthly data\\n\\n- Monthly aggregated data used: N = 8\\n- Total studies included in analysis: N = 39\\n\\nNote: Some studies were included in the search because the term \\'rotavirus\\' appeared in the text (i.e., abstract, introduction).\\n\\nFigure 1.

GIMMS processing also reduces NDVI variations that arise from sensor band calibration, volcanic aerosols, cloud cover and water vapor. We acquired GIMMS data on a bimonthly basis as a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composite product with 1 km spatial resolution [24]. MODIS Terra data are hosted by NASA’s Warehouse Inventory Search Tool (WIST) and are available from 2000 to present at temporal resolutions of 16 days and 1 month and spatial resolutions of 250 m, 500 m, 1 km and 0.25 degrees.\\n\\nFrom the MODIS Terra satellite, we acquired monthly composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data at 1 km resolution. We chose 1 km spatial resolution to remain consistent with the GIMMS data. Although MODIS data are available on a bimonthly basis, we acquired monthly composite data to help remove errors caused by clouds, sun glare, and the satellite instrument itself [25] and to match the monthly rotavirus time series. The MODIS sensor has many advantages over the AVHRR satellite series for calculating vegetation indices. MODIS offers a higher spatial resolution and also has narrower bandwidths in the red and near infrared that improve its sensitivity to chlorophyll and produces less distortion from atmospheric water vapor [25].\\n\\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measures vegetation cover, and over time can be used to monitor plant growth. NDVI is calculated as follows [26]:\\n\\nNDVI = (rnir - rred) / (rnir + rred)\\n\\nWhere rnir is the reflectance in the near-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and rred is the reflectance in the red region. In the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, causing low red-light reflectance. In the near-infrared portion of the spectrum, the leaf’s spongy mesophyll causes high reflectance. NDVI values range from -1.0 to 1.0, where healthy vegetation has increasingly positive values and decreasing negative values indicate rock, soil, snow, ice or clouds [27].\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org | May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e38168\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia'),\n",

Liu and Huete [28] defined EVI as follows:\\n\\nEVI = G * (rnir - (C1 * rred - C2 * rblue)) + L * rnir - rred\\n\\nwhere L is a soil adjustment factor. C1 and C2 are coefficients that correct the red band for aerosol scattering by factoring in the blue band. Reflectance values for the near-infrared, red, and blue wavelengths are designated by rnir, rred, and rblue, respectively. Usually, G = 2.5, C1 = 6.0, C2 = 7.5, and L = 1.\\n\\nAlthough MODIS Terra provides both NDVI and EVI products, we chose to analyze the EVI product for several important reasons. EVI is better at correcting for distortions caused by reflected light from particles in the air and from the ground cover below the vegetation. In areas with heavy vegetation, EVI is more sensitive to small changes and does not become saturated as easily as NDVI. NDVI responds mostly to variations in the red band which occur from chlorophyll, whereas EVI depends more upon the near-infrared band that is responsive to structural variations in the canopy [25].\\n\\n# Data Standardization\\n\\nThe studies selected for this analysis used different measures for rotavirus outcome. Of the 39 studies, 25 studies (64.1%) presented outcome data as number of cases, 13 studies (33.3%) presented outcome as percent positive stools, and one study (2.6%) presented the outcome as incidence. In order to standardize different outcome measures the raw values were normalized into z-scores on a time series-by-time series basis. The z-score was calculated using the mean and standard deviation for the complete duration (all months) of each study as follows:\\n\\nZij = (uij - μu) / σi\\n\\nwhere Zij is the z-score for the actual value for outcome, uij (rotavirus cases, incidence or percent positive stools), for time series i in month j and μu and σi are the mean and standard deviation for each time series, respectively. We also standardized exposure characteristics (temperature, precipitation and vegetation index) to adjust for location specific variations and assess relative associations [22].\\n\\n# Data Analysis: Mixed Effects Models\\n\\nThe relationship between the normalized outcome and meteorological parameters was examined using a regression model adapted to time series data. We applied a linear mixed effects model to link the z-score of monthly rotavirus values with z-score of temperature, z-score of precipitation, and z-score of VI individually and control for the length of the time series at each study location. The mixed effects regression model was defined as follows:\\n\\nYij = β0 + β1Xij + b0i + b1iXij + eij\\n\\nwhere Yij is the rotavirus z-score, and Xij is the exposure of interest (temperature z-score, precipitation z-score, or VI z-score), the fixed effects: β0 is the population intercept, β1 is the population slope, and random effects: b0i is the study intercept and b1i is the study slope. The mixed effects model accounts for unequal lengths of time series included in the analysis, so studies which contribute less data have a smaller effect on the overall results. This model also allows us to explore the relationship between temporal fluctuations in rotavirus and meteorological conditions of each study as compared to the overall pattern for all studies.\\n\\nWe considered four regression models. Model 1 was defined as the synchronous model and assessed the association between rotavirus z-score and temperature, precipitation, and VI z-score individually. In Model 2, the exposure was lagged by one month to assess whether increased rotavirus rates are associated with temperature, precipitation and VI exposure from the previous month. Model 3 was the synchronous model (Model 1) adjusted for the distance from the equator. In Model 3, we included the square of the study location’s latitude to emphasize proximity to the equator and the interaction with the exposure in the regression model as a fixed effect for each individual exposure predictor to control for the location’s distance from the equator. By adjusting for the distance from the equator we can account, in part, for heterogeneity in the interaction between annual temperature and precipitation levels and overall climate characteristics. Finally, in Model 4 the exposure was lagged by one month and the model was adjusted for the distance from the equator. Regression parameters were tested at α = 0.05 significance level. All analysis was conducted using R Software (Version 2.9.2).\\n\\nThe regression parameters can be interpreted in terms of the z-score; a one unit change in z-score of an exposure variable is associated with an estimated change in z-score of the dependent variable. A one unit change in z-score is equivalent to the standard deviation change in the outcome measure.\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\n#\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis research paper explores the seasonal patterns of rotavirus infections in South Asia, analyzing the correlation between climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation with the incidence of rotavirus.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in children worldwide.

Annual seasonal patterns were examined for study locations that included rotavirus data for 3 or more years using Poisson harmonic regression. There were six study locations which included sufficient data for detailed seasonality analysis. Seasonality is characterized as systematic, periodic fluctuations within the course of a year. It is assessed by several parameters: 1) the time when the seasonal curve reaches its maximum, 2) annual maximum value (peak), and 3) annual minimum value (nadir) [31]. These seasonal parameters are calculated based on values predicted by the harmonic regression:\\n\\nln (E½y)~b0zb1 sin (2pvt)zb2 cos (2pvt)\\nt\\nzb3 sin (4pvt)zb4 cos (4pvt)zet\\n\\nwhere yt is a time-series rotavirus z-score, t is time in months, v is frequency (v = 1/12), b0 is intercept, b1, b2, b3, and b4 are regression parameters, and et is the error term. We use two harmonics to account for the double peak seen in several time series. Using the estimate for the regression parameters, we calculated peak timing and intensity based on the d – method [32]. The relative intensity, a measure of the shape of the seasonal pattern from peak to nadir, is calculated by dividing the estimated seasonal maximum value by the estimated seasonal minimum value.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nA total of 47 time series were used in this analysis to assess the relationship between monthly rotavirus rate in South Asia with ambient temperature and precipitation. All study locations provided a total of 1046 months of data; on average, each study location had 22 months of data. The scatterplots of independent variables with rotavirus z-score demonstrate a stronger association in temperature for both climate categories than in precipitation and vegetation index (Figure 3). Descriptive analysis illustrates the average values of temperature, cumulative precipitation, and vegetation index for all study locations and also for each climate subcategory (Table 2). As all studies are from South Asia, there is little difference in the average temperature range by climate categories. The primary variation by climate category is seen in precipitation. The vegetation index is similar for moist tropical areas (A) and humid mid-latitude areas (C); but averaged much smaller values in the arid and semiarid region (B).\\n\\nThe highest levels of rotavirus are seen in the colder, drier months of the year (December–March). When assessing synchronized relationships (Model 1), all exposure parameters, temperature, precipitation, and VI z-score were significant negative predictors of rotavirus z-score and this relationship held for both the tropical (Climate A) and humid-mid latitude (Climate C) climates (Table 3). For all studies, a one unit increase in temperature z-score, precipitation z-score and VI z-score resulted in a 20.379 (95% CI: 20.435, 20.323), 20.246 (95% CI: 20.305, 20.188), and 20.253 (95% CI: 20.314, 20.193) unit decrease in the rotavirus z-score, respectively. Therefore, the overall effect of a 1°C decrease in monthly ambient temperature is associated with 0.078 unit increase above the annual rotavirus level, which is proportional to 1.3% increase in rotavirus infections. Similarly, a decrease of 10 mm in precipitation is associated with 0.3% increase in rotavirus infections. A decrease of 0.1 units in vegetation index for a seasonal change – compared to the annual norm of 0.3 – is associated with a 3.8% increase above the annual rotavirus level. In the tropical climates (Climate A) temperature is more strongly associated with a decrease in rotavirus and in the humid mid-latitude climate (Climate C) temperature and precipitation have similar negative association with rotavirus z-score. In the tropical climates a decrease of 1°C from annual average of 26.2°C in monthly ambient temperature is associated with 0.13 unit increase above the rotavirus annual level, or a 2.2% increase in rotavirus infections, while in the humid mid-latitude climate (Climate C) a decrease of 1°C in temperature below annual mean of 24.2°C results in lesser but significant.\\n\\n# Table 2.

We found that higher rates of rotavirus are associated with cold, dry months. Our study demonstrates that the strength of these associations varies by climate category. The use of standardized z-scores allows for direct comparisons of detected effects across geographical zones with different weather conditions and across various measures of disease. This study also demonstrates the utility of the remote sensing vegetation index in assessing seasonal associations.\\n\\nThe seasonal pattern seen in rotavirus varies by climatic region and is also associated with local weather. Our findings agree with a review of studies in tropical regions which found that a reduction of rotavirus rates was associated with increases in temperature and precipitation. Our analysis focuses on South Asia, which includes both temperate and tropical areas, whereas the Levy et al. study includes just the tropics; only seven out of 39 studies were included in both analyses. The similarity of findings indicates that both studies capture a unique and stable phenomenon suggesting an effect of climate and local weather on the seasonal pattern of rotavirus infection: an increase in the rate of rotavirus in cooler and drier times of the year for a given location. The Levy et al. study acknowledged the diversity of climates prevalent even within the defined tropical band.\\n\\nIn our study, we controlled for various climatic regions by classifying each study using Köppen Climate Classification. Most of the study locations we examined fell into only two broad classifications, tropical climates (Climate A) and humid mid-latitude climates (Climate C). With the limited number of studies, we were only able to use the broadest categories though the Köppen Climate Classification system provides more detail. Within the broad tropical climate (A) category, there are three subcategories which are distinguished by precipitation patterns and in the mid-latitude climate (C) category there are six subcategories which are distinguished by type of summer as well as precipitation patterns. However, we did demonstrate different degrees of association between meteorological characteristics and rotavirus prevalence by climate category. In tropical climates (Climate A), an increase in temperature was associated with a greater decrease in rotavirus than in humid mid-latitude climates (Climate C). We also found that temperature is a stronger predictor of the rate of rotavirus after controlling for the study latitude.\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\nThe primary reasons for seasonal fluctuation in rotavirus prevalence are still unknown. Typically for a virus, it is not expected that the seasonal relationship would be primarily driven by a favorable environment for the pathogen. Temporal and geographic trends have been better recognized in temperate than tropical climates, perhaps because though temperatures vary across seasons, temperatures do not reach the lower levels seen in temperate climates, or patterns of disease prevalence are not as marked.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that the seasonal pattern seen in rotavirus may be driven by airborne transmission of the disease. The drop in humidity and rainfall dries the soils which may increase the aerial transport of the contaminated fecal matter. In the U.S., the seasonal pattern in rotavirus shifts by geographic location with peak activity occurring first in the Southwest from October through December and last in the Northeast between March and May. Influenza has also demonstrated strong seasonal patterns and associations with humidity.\\n\\nA seasonal pattern similar to that of rotavirus has been demonstrated for influenza in the U.S., with peak activity beginning in the Southwest in mid-December and shifting to the Northeast towards mid-January.'),\n",

Pitzer et al. suggest that the seasonal pattern seen in rotavirus in the U.S. is influenced by spatiotemporal patterns in birth rate and that young children experiencing their first infection of rotavirus are the primary drivers of epidemics and therefore of the seasonal patterns. As mentioned by Bobak et al., in populations with reliable data, birth rates vary by season of the year. In the U.S., most births occur in the summer and early fall and the fewest births are seen in the spring which can be explained by temperature and light effects. Seasonal patterns in birth rates have been demonstrated in South Asia, though specific regional patterns are not clear. In regions with distinct periods of very high temperatures, a drop in births at this time can be noticeable, especially in developing countries, which may, in part, explain our findings in the tropical climates. Seasonality of newborn susceptibility might be insufficient to warrant disease seasonality.\\n\\nIt is likely that seasonal patterns can be reinforced by changes in rotavirus genotype. In the temperate climate of England and Wales, where rotavirus infections are highly seasonal, a child’s risk of a laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection in the first year of life was significantly higher for children born in summer compared to those born in the winter. The authors suggested that maternal immunity and age-specific levels of exposure to rotavirus could explain the findings. Our preliminary findings suggest that the seasonal pattern for rotavirus may vary by strain type. A similar meta-analysis approach may be used to assess the differing seasonality by strain type.\\n\\nSchool schedules and holiday travel may also affect the seasonal pattern of rotavirus infections by changing the probability of exposure to the virus. Other viral diseases, influenza in particular, have demonstrated associations with holiday travel and school schedules. In many countries, vacations and family travels are somewhat synchronized and it may be difficult to separate the independent effects. Given the potential airborne transmission of rotavirus, it can be expected that the seasonal pattern may be driven by crowdedness. Rotavirus is most prevalent in children under 5 years of age.\\n\\n**Estimated Peak Timing from Poisson Harmonic Regression**\\n|Study Reference|Location (City, Country)|Study Duration (Months)|Estimated Peak 1 (95% CI)|p-value|Calendar Interpretation of Estimated Peak 1|Relative Intensity|Estimated Peak 2 (95% CI)|p-value|Calendar Interpretation of Estimated Peak 2|Relative Intensity|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|[44]|Chandigarh, India|46|12.99 (11.42, 2.56)|0.326|4 week of December|1.12|6.31 (5.84, 6.78)|0.361|2 week of June|1.48|\\n|[50]|New Delhi, India|84|11.25 (10.06, 12.44)|0.291|1 week of November|1.21|8.20 (7.72, 8.54)|0.380|1 week of August|1.47|\\n|[63]|Dhaka, Bangladesh|48|11.84 (11.65, 12.04)|0.044|4 week of November|1.61|8.11 (7.69, 8.54)|0.351|1 week of August|1.41|\\n|[65]|Matlab, Bangladesh|65|12.93 (12.70, 1.16)|0.0003|4 week of December|2.00|7.95 (7.82, 8.08)|0.006|4 week of July|1.57|\\n|[73]|Pune, India|48|1.05 (12.71, 1.38)|0.059|1 week of January|1.56|11.51 (11.31, 11.71)|0.374|3 week of November|1.40|\\n---\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n.doi {\\nfont-size: 0.8em;\\ncolor: #007BFF;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia\\n\\nFigure 4.

For the studies in which averages were used, temperature and precipitation may not represent the weather specific to the year for which rotavirus data is available. This may limit the precision of our estimates of associations with meteorological factors. Humidity has also been shown to be associated with rotavirus seasonality [8,11]. An earlier analysis of birth cohort data from Vellore, India, demonstrated a positive correlation between humidity and the strain-specific incidence of rotavirus diarrhea [41]. However, humidity is another factor for which consistent data was difficult to obtain for all study locations.\\n\\nTo overcome this limitation, we consider the use of remote sensing data to provide a proxy for meteorological characteristics for areas in which direct measures of temperature and precipitation are not available. The Vegetation Index (VI) is a measure of the combined effect of temperature and precipitation and is therefore a strong proxy for humidity as well. Study specific temperature and precipitation data was available for only 75% of study months whereas VI measures were available for 93% of study months. A strength of this analysis is the demonstration of the use of VI as a proxy for the combined effect of temperature and precipitation.\\n\\nThe precision of our estimates may also be affected by the coarse monthly temporal aggregation. The incubation period for rotavirus is short, approximately 2 days, and the disease is highly infectious which suggests that the seasonal peak of disease may be very short [33]. A finer temporal aggregation, of weeks or days, for rotavirus data would allow us to capture the short peak more effectively.'),\n",

For the underlying cause of rotavirus seasonality, the meteorological factor has been suspected, whereas quantitative correlation between seasonality and meteorological factor has not been fully investigated. In this study, we investigated the correlation of temporal patterns of the isolation rate of rotavirus with meteorological condition (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall) in Kolkata, India. We used time-series analysis combined with spectral analysis and least squares method. A 1-year cycle explained underlying variations of rotavirus and meteorological data. The 1-year cycle for rotavirus data was correlated with an opposite phase to that for meteorological data. Relatively high temperature could be associated with a low value of isolation rate of rotavirus in the monsoon season. Quantifying a correlation of rotavirus infections with meteorological conditions might prove useful in predicting rotavirus epidemics and health services could plan accordingly.\\n\\nKey words: Analysis of data, climate – impact of, rotavirus, statistics, surveillance.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is the most common aetiological agent of severe diarrhoea in children worldwide. Globally, rotavirus accounted for 527,000 deaths in children aged <5 years in 2004, representing 5% of all deaths in this age group. Twenty-three percent of deaths due to rotavirus disease were estimated to occur in India alone. Annually, India paid US$41–72 million in medical expenses for the treatment of rotavirus diarrhoea. For prevention of this disease and alleviation of its economic burden on India, it is necessary to understand the epidemiological factors of rotavirus epidemics; for this, the mechanism of seasonality of such epidemics is of great interest.\\n\\nAn observational investigation of the seasonality of rotavirus disease visually confirmed that higher numbers of rotavirus infections in the tropics were found at colder and drier times of the year. This temporal behaviour of rotavirus epidemics was confirmed in the case of Kolkata, India, with surveillance data collected during the period 1979–1981. Furthermore, it was seen that the seasonality of rotavirus infections in Kolkata is inversely correlated with three kinds of meteorological conditions: temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall.\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: Dr A.

For data collection, every fifth hospitalized patient with diarrhoea or dysentery without other associated illness on two randomly selected days in a week was enrolled, resulting in 45,004 patients. Of these 45,004 patients, stool specimens were collected from 2,519 cases for aetiological study. In Figure 1, monthly data of cases enrolled via surveillance, positive cases of rotavirus from stool specimens, and isolation rate of rotavirus are illustrated. In the present study, the time-series analysis was conducted for monthly data of isolation rate of rotavirus gathered over 26 months from November 2007 to December 2009 (26 data points).\\n\\n# Meteorological Data\\n\\nData on daily maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were collected in the study region by the Meteorological Department, Kolkata, and the time span and number of data were identical to those for the rotavirus data. Daily average temperatures were computed as the mean of the daily maximum and minimum values. The monthly means for average temperature, relative humidity and total rainfall were calculated from daily records.\\n\\nSeason was categorized as pre-monsoon (March–May), monsoon (June–September), post-monsoon (October–November) and winter (December–February).\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the following two points for Kolkata during the period 2007–2009: (i) whether temporal patterns of rotavirus infections were inversely correlated with those of temperature, relative humidity and rainfall, as reported previously, and (ii) whether the occurrence of rotavirus infection in the monsoon season is associated with high temperature, as is the case of Bangladesh. For aims (i) and (ii), we applied our method of analysis to the time-series data of rotavirus infections and meteorological conditions in Kolkata.\\n\\nWe used the method of time-series analysis combined with spectral analysis based on the maximum entropy method (MEM) in frequency domain and least squares method (LSM) in time domain, as proposed in our previous work. The time-series analysis revealed an association between rotavirus epidemics and meteorological factors, which are not visually apparent. For explanation of the present method of time-series analysis, we used the time-series data of the isolation rate of rotavirus.\\n\\n# Data\\n\\nSurveillance data used in our study were collected at the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BGH) in Kolkata between November 2007 and December 2009.\\n\\nThe pre-processing of the original data of the isolation rate of rotavirus was conducted by the choice of an equal sampling interval, and the modified time-series data thus obtained are illustrated in Figure 2a. As a result, 26 data points of the original data were prepared for analysis.\\n\\nFigure 1: Monthly data of cases enrolled via surveillance, positive cases of rotavirus from stool specimens, and isolation rate of rotavirus.\\n\\nFigure 2a: Modified time-series data of the isolation rate of rotavirus.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Surveillance\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.data-figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Surveillance\\n\\n# Data Overview\\n\\nFigure 1 illustrates the monthly data on enrolled cases from the surveillance data, positive cases of rotavirus from stool specimens, and the isolation rate of rotavirus.\\n\\nFig. 1.

Cross-correlations (r) between the residual data of isolation rate for rotavirus and that for: (a) temperature, (b) relative humidity, and (c) rainfall.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe significant result of our study was to demonstrate that the 1-year periodic mode for rotavirus data was correlated in an opposite phase to that for the meteorological data recorded from November 2007 to December 2009 in Kolkata, India. Specifically, rotavirus infections increase as the values of temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall data decrease, and vice versa. This finding is comparable with that of Saha et al.’s study using data recorded from July 1979 to June 1981 in Kolkata, despite the advancements in detection methods for rotavirus.\\n\\nFor detection of rotavirus, specificity of PAGE was reported as 100%, higher than that of ELISA, although ELISA showed slightly higher sensitivity than PAGE. Therefore, in our study, the incidence of rotavirus may be more accurate than in earlier studies, providing more appropriate conclusions in the analysis of the effects of meteorological conditions on rotavirus infections.\\n\\nIn our study, temporal patterns of rotavirus infections and meteorological conditions were elucidated by conducting a time-series analysis combined with MEM spectral analysis and LSM. As a result, we obtained valuable knowledge on the temporal structures of the time-series data which had remained unresolved until now. Previous studies investigated the correlation between rotavirus infections and meteorological conditions using the linear Poisson regression model. However, this model assumed the fluctuating part in the analysis, which may not fully capture the complexities of the data.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Infections and Meteorological Conditions\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh2 {\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Infections and Meteorological Conditions\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the relationship between rotavirus infections and meteorological conditions, particularly focusing on temperature, rainfall, and humidity in Kolkata.

Rotavirus is typically less seasonal in the tropics, although recent observational studies have challenged the universality of this pattern. While numerous studies have examined the association between environmental factors and rotavirus incidence, here we explore the role of intrinsic factors. By fitting a mathematical model of rotavirus transmission dynamics to published age distributions of cases from 15 countries, we obtain estimates of local transmission rates. Model-predicted patterns of seasonal incidence based solely on differences in birth rates and transmission rates are significantly correlated with those observed (Spearman’s r = 0.65, p < 0.05). We then examine seasonal patterns of rotavirus predicted across a range of different birth rates and transmission rates and explore how vaccination may impact these patterns. Our results suggest that the relative lack of rotavirus seasonality observed in many tropical countries may be due to the high birth rates and transmission rates typical of developing countries rather than being driven primarily by environmental conditions. While vaccination is expected to decrease the overall burden of disease, it may increase the degree of seasonal variation in the incidence of rotavirus in some settings.\\n\\nKeywords: rotavirus; seasonality; vaccination; infectious disease modelling\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is one of the leading causes of severe diarrhoea in children in both developed and developing countries, and is estimated to cause over half a million deaths worldwide with much of this mortality burden concentrated in developing countries. Two separate vaccines against rotavirus have been recently developed and licensed in many countries throughout the world. Early observations of vaccine impact in the USA, Australia and several countries in Latin America and Europe have highlighted the enormous promise such vaccines hold for preventing rotavirus-associated diarrhoea. Clinical trials have estimated that vaccine recipients benefit from a 49–98% reduction in the risk of severe rotavirus diarrhoea depending on the setting, with lower efficacy being observed in low-income regions of Africa and Asia. However, predicting the population-level impact of vaccination and the importance of herd immunity requires an understanding of the dynamics of infection. This can be achieved through mathematical modelling studies rooted in biological and epidemiological data.\\n\\nThe spatio-temporal patterning of disease can provide important insight into the underlying transmission dynamics of infections. Using a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of rotavirus, we have previously shown that the apparent travelling wave of rotavirus infection in the USA from southwest to northeast may be due to underlying geographical variability in birth rates. This pattern is no longer apparent in the post-vaccination era, suggesting that susceptible recruitment rather than environmental factors plays a key role in determining the timing of rotavirus activity in the US. The model can also explain the much diminished and delayed peak in rotavirus activity observed during the 2007–2008 season following the licensing of the RotaTeq vaccine in the US in 2006, providing an important source of model validation. Furthermore, the model allows quantification of the relative importance of direct and indirect (herd immunity) protection, which is essential in determining the long-term impact of vaccination.\\n\\nReceived 2 February 2011\\n\\nAccepted 28 March 2011\\n\\nThis journal is © 2011 The Royal Society\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\n# V.

The dynamics of rotavirus infection may differ significantly between these regions due to various factors including climatic conditions, birth rates, and sanitation levels.\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nRoutine immunization against rotavirus has only been introduced in developed countries, South Africa, and a few developing countries in Latin America. The majority of rotavirus deaths occur in poorer nations, and the impact of vaccination in these settings remains unclear.\\n\\nRotavirus activity has traditionally been thought to lack seasonality in tropical regions, leading to high levels of year-round disease transmission. However, recent assessments suggest that seasonal patterns may vary significantly across different countries and over time.\\n\\nFactors such as birth rates, crowding, and sanitation are expected to influence rotavirus transmission dynamics. In developing countries, higher birth rates and varying climatic conditions may contribute to the observed seasonality of rotavirus infections.\\n\\n# 2. Methods\\n\\n# 2.1. Epidemiological Data\\n\\nTo estimate mean rotavirus transmission rates, we fitted our model to published age distributions of rotavirus cases in children under 5 years from 15 countries. We conducted a literature search to identify relevant studies published between 2005 and 2010.\\n\\nWe required studies to report confirmed rotavirus cases by month over a period of at least 2 years. Data extraction was performed using DIGITIZEIT software when necessary. Birth rate data were obtained from the World Population Prospects database, assuming constancy over time.\\n\\n# 2.2. Transmission Model\\n\\nOur age-structured model for rotavirus transmission dynamics assumes that susceptible individuals can be infected, recover, and become temporarily immune. The model accounts for reduced susceptibility following previous infections.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe environmental and demographic factors driving seasonality in rotavirus transmission require further elucidation. Our findings suggest that dynamic resonance may explain geographical variations in rotavirus seasonality, and we explore the potential impact of vaccination on these patterns.\\n\\nReferences: [13], [20], [21–23], [24], [25–28], [29], [30,31], [32,33], [34,35], [36–48], [49–51]\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\nAuthors: V.

After that, we assume individuals only experience asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) infections that are less infectious and not reported. After examining the age distributions of cases from different countries, we modified the model to more accurately capture the nature of maternal immunity (and/or limited exposure to rotavirus during the first 6 months of life due to social/behavioural factors). Maternal immunity appeared to be stronger than previously assumed, as indicated by a relative dearth of cases in the zero to five months age group, particularly in the lowest income countries. Thus, we split the maternal immunity compartment into six separate compartments and estimated a common duration of time spent in each compartment by fitting the model to the mean age distribution of cases from all countries combined.\\n\\nThe rotavirus transmission rate was assumed to vary sinusoidally with a period of 1 year as follows: b(t) = b0(1 + a cos(2π(t - w))), where b0 is the baseline transmission rate, a is the amplitude of seasonality and w is a seasonal offset parameter. Mixing was assumed to be homogeneous, such that b0 was the same for all age groups. We examined the sensitivity of our results to this assumption in the electronic supplementary material. The sinusoidal variation in the transmission rate is presumably related to environmental factors that could influence rotavirus transmission, such as the effect of temperature or humidity on virus survival or increased population crowding during cold or rainy months. However, the factors influencing this have yet to be fully elucidated.\\n\\nWe varied the birth rate and baseline transmission rate while holding the amplitude of seasonal variation in the transmission rate, a, constant at 5 percent, a level similar to that estimated for the USA. This allowed us to examine seasonality in the incidence of severe rotavirus diarrhoea predicted by the model independent of environmental factors. Other dynamic models for rotavirus have estimated the amplitude of seasonal variation in the transmission rate to be similar albeit slightly higher in England and Wales (a = 9.2%) and Kyrgyzstan (a = 7.9%). If seasonal variation in the transmission rate is tied to factors such as temperature and humidity, however, it might be expected to exhibit lower amplitude in the tropics. We conducted sensitivity analyses with a = 2.5 and 10%, and examined the effect of modelling seasonal variation in the transmission rate using a step function (see the electronic supplementary material).\\n\\nThe degree of seasonal fluctuation in incidence (s) predicted by the model was measured as:\\n\\ns = (max x - x) / x * 100%, where xmax is the peak number and x is the mean number of clinical rotavirus cases per week (in all age groups) over a 2 year period, to account for the possible occurrence of biennial epidemics. To quantify the observed seasonality, we first aggregated the data by month of the year then compared the mean rotavirus incidence in the three months surrounding the peak to the mean incidence for the entire 12 month period to limit the influence of stochastic variation in the number of rotavirus cases.\\n\\nWe calculated the basic reproductive number of primary infections, R0, and used it as a measure of transmissibility (see the electronic supplementary material). We first examined the dynamics of rotavirus epidemics predicted by the model at the observed birth rate and estimated R0 for each of the 15 countries, then across CBRs ranging from five to 50 live births per 1000 and R0 ranging from 20 to 100, consistent with most of the estimated global variation in these parameters (table 1).\\n\\n# Impact of Vaccination\\n\\nWe then examined the impact of vaccination on patterns of rotavirus disease incidence predicted by the model.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\n# V.

The degree of seasonal fluctuation in incidence of rotavirus diarrhoea predicted by the model is indicated by the colour bar. The larger red–yellow region corresponds to strong annual epidemics, while the smaller red region in the lower left-hand corner corresponds to biennial epidemics.\\n\\nA region of strong seasonality was also noted when both birth rates and transmission rates were very low. There may be a transition period soon after vaccine introduction in which seasonal incidence is more pronounced. Exploration revealed that epidemics occurred biennially in this parameter region. Countries most at risk for increased peak incidence following the introduction of rotavirus vaccination are those with intermediate birth rates and transmission rates. Given our estimates of R0 for the representative countries with published age distributions, this may include countries such as Uzbekistan.\\n\\nCountries such as Cambodia and Nepal with slightly higher birth rates and transmission rates could experience similar phenomena as vaccine coverage levels reach 90 per cent or more, with a vaccine efficacy of 80 per cent. However, it may be difficult to achieve this level of effective coverage if the vaccine is less efficacious in such settings.\\n\\nThe proportion of infants infected prior to four months of age also showed a strong dependence on both the birth rate and the transmission rate. At high birth rates and transmission rates, up to 12 per cent of infants may be infected with rotavirus prior to four months of age, which is the recommended age at which the second dose of rotavirus vaccine is administered in most developed countries. Thus, vaccination may not have as great an impact initially in such settings if vaccination is not as effective in previously infected infants.\\n\\nHowever, vaccination is expected to lead to a decrease in the force of infection (i.e., incidence rate per susceptible individual) and thus a delay in the time to infection, such that the proportion of infants infected prior to four months of age decreased substantially at high levels of vaccine coverage. This could lead to an increase in vaccine impact over time under these assumptions.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nMuch of the promise of rotavirus vaccines lies in their ability to reduce the incidence of severe disease in populations with varying birth and transmission rates.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\n#\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\nV.

E. Pitzer et al.\\n\\nDownloaded from http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/ on February 12, 2015\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nRates can partially explain the observed variation in rotavirus seasonality. Our model also suggests that vaccination could have the unexpected consequence of increasing the seasonality of rotavirus disease in countries with intermediate-to-high birth rates and/or transmission rates while still reducing the mean annual incidence of disease.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nWhile the combination of birth rates and transmission rates are likely important determinants of the magnitude of seasonal variation and can affect small differences in the timing of epidemics, these factors do not explain why rotavirus tends to occur more frequently during the cool, dry season in both temperate and tropical regions. Environmental factors such as temperature and/or humidity probably play a role in organizing the peak of rotavirus transmission to times when conditions are most favourable to virus survivability and transmission.\\n\\n# Seasonality Observations\\n\\nPronounced seasonality has been observed in subtropical and tropical countries, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as regions of Venezuela and Brazil. By contrast, temperate countries such as Uzbekistan exhibit only weak seasonal variation in rotavirus incidence. The combination of lower birth rates and/or lower transmission rates may help in explaining why rotavirus tends to be moderately to strongly seasonal in certain countries.\\n\\n# Impact of Vaccination\\n\\nThe effect of vaccination is dynamically similar to a reduction in the birth rate since the number of fully susceptible infants entering the population is decreased. Our model suggests vaccination may alter the dynamics of rotavirus in countries with intermediate birth rates and transmission rates, leading to a pattern of more seasonal epidemic disease.\\n\\n# Challenges in Developing Countries\\n\\nIn developing countries with high birth rates and transmission rates, achieving high coverage with a fully effective vaccine may not be as feasible. There are a number of possible explanations for this reduced efficacy related to host and environmental factors, including higher rates of breastfeeding and higher levels of transplacental maternal antibodies.\\n\\n# Maternal Immunity\\n\\nThe fit of our model to the age distribution of cases in different countries reveals an element of added complexity in the nature of maternal immunity and protection against rotavirus. The strength and duration of maternal immunity appear to be greater than previously assumed in models of rotavirus transmission.\\n\\nJ. R. Soc.

Konno, H. Suzuki, N. Katsushima, A. Imai, F. Tazawa, T. Kutsuzawa, S. Kitaoka, M. Sakamoto, N. Yazaki, and N. Ishida\\n\\nFrom the Departments of Pediatrics and Bacteriology, Tohoku University School of Medicine and Yamagata City Hospital (Saiseikan), Sendai, Japan\\n\\nA climatologic analysis of human rotavirus infection in inpatients with acute diarrhea was conducted over a seven-year period. The infection frequency appeared to be related to temperature, but not to relative humidity. Human rotavirus infection was found to appear abruptly when the mean temperature of any 10-day period became &lt;5 °C (November or December), reached a peak when it was &lt;0 °C (January and February), and waned when it became &gt;20 °C (June and July) in the city of Yamagata in northern Japan.\\n\\nThe use of electron microscopy for the detection of viruses in the feces of diarrheal children led to the discovery of several gastroenteritis viruses. Human rotavirus, one of these viruses, is a major cause of gastroenteritis in infants in many parts of the world. In temperate areas, human rotavirus infection is prevalent usually only in the cooler months, although it is common even in tropical countries. What factors underlie the climatic variations in rotavirus infection still remain unknown. We previously reported that human rotavirus was the major pathogen identified in hospitalized Japanese children with gastroenteritis in the colder months. The present communication describes the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the frequency of human rotavirus infections in inpatients over a seven-year period.\\n\\n# Patients and Methods\\n\\nPatients with acute diarrhea who were admitted to the pediatric ward of Yamagata City Hospital (Saiseikan) in Yamagata Prefecture between December 1974 and June 1981 were included in this study. There was little difference in the socioeconomic status of the patients. The patients usually had, in addition to diarrhea, vomiting, slight fever, and complications due to mild-to-moderate dehydration. The total number of patients examined was 1,910; their ages ranged from 18 days to 14 years. Diagnostic samples from these patients were generally obtained on the first or second day of hospitalization. Electron microscopy was used to examine the potential viral pathogens in the fecal specimens obtained.\\n\\nThe city of Yamagata (population, 250,000) is located at 38°15' north latitude and 40°41' east longitude and lies 150.6 m above sea level. Outdoor temperature and relative humidity data were obtained from monthly reports published by the Japan Meteorological Agency, composed of monthly, 10-day, and daily summaries. The daily mean temperature was obtained from values recorded at 3, 5, and 9 A.M., 12 M., and 3, 6, 9, and 12 P.M. The daily mean relative humidity was obtained from values recorded at 3 and 9 A.M. and 3 P.M.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nDetection of virus by electron microscopy. Human rotavirus was detected by electron microscopy in stool specimens of 859 of the 1,910 patients examined. Among the other viral agents detected by electron microscopy in the stool specimens, adenovirus was found in 87 patients (4.6%) and calicivirus and small, round, viruslike particles in 18 patients (0.9%).\\n\\nReceived for publication June 15, 1982, and in revised form August 27, 1982.

Rotaviruses were not found at all during the summer months in Washington, D.C. [2], but they were detected in about 200/0 of the patients with diarrhea in London [3] and Melbourne [4]. In tropical areas such as Venezuela [6] and Ecuador [7], no seasonal variation occurs, whereas human rotavirus infection has been reported in the dry seasons in Costa Rica [8], India [9], and Bangladesh [10].\\n\\nThe city of Yamagata is located among mountains in northern Honshu, Japan\\'s largest island. A climatologic feature is high relative humidity in winter as well as in summer. Thus, the occurrence of human rotavirus infection appeared not to be related to relative humidity. On the other hand, as shown by frequent outbreaks of infection in the cooler months, infection appeared to be closely related to temperature, beginning abruptly at ~5 °C and ceasing around 20 °C. It is of interest that there was such a disparity between the temperatures at which human rotavirus infection begins and ends. The reason for this phenomenon remains unknown, but not only temperature but also unknown factors may be assumed to influence the occurrence of this infection.

This organism has been recognized as a parasite of a wide variety of vertebrates, but it was not known to cause disease in humans until 1976. Since then, it has been identified as a cause of sporadic human gastrointestinal disease as well as of large outbreaks, particularly water-borne outbreaks. It has been estimated that between 250 million and 500 million humans are infected annually with Cryptosporidium in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Over the last 9 years (1996–2004), a total of 5744 laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis cases have been identified in Queensland, Australia. The major symptoms are abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea. In immunocompromised hosts, Cryptosporidium can cause severe and life-threatening diarrhea. The incubation period for cryptosporidiosis ranges from 2 to 12 days and averages about 7 days. There is no effective treatment for the disease, and thus prevention remains the sole public health strategy.\\n\\nThe incidence of cryptosporidiosis has been shown to peak between summer and autumn. However, the patterns reported have been variable, with higher prevalence in hot months, cool months, or rainy seasons. The reasons for such seasonal heterogeneity are poorly understood. Furthermore, few studies have examined the relationship between weather variables and cryptosporidiosis in literature, although there appears to be seasonal patterns of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nTime series analyses have been increasingly used in epidemiological research. Both generalized linear models (GLMs), in particular Poisson regression, and seasonal auto-regression integrated moving average (SARIMA) models have been widely used in the analyses of time series data. Recently, more flexible semiparametric extensions in the form of generalized additive models (GAMs) have also been used for epidemiological time series. SARIMA models have been traditionally used for forecasting in economics and have become well established in epidemiological studies.\\n---\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\nmargin-bottom: 5px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.abbreviations {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\nfont-size: 14px;\\n}\\n.abbreviations table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\n}\\n.abbreviations th, .abbreviations td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\n}\\n.abbreviations th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nAuthors: Hu et al.\\n\\nPublished in: AEP Vol. 17, No. 9, September 2007, pp. 679–688\\n\\n# Selected Abbreviations and Acronyms\\n\\n|Abbreviation|Meaning|\\n|---|---|\\n|AIC|Akaike information criterion|\\n|GAM|Generalized additive model|\\n|GLIM|Generalized linear model|\\n|RMSE|Root mean square error|\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis paper examines the potential impact of weather variability on the transmission of cryptosporidiosis, explores the difference in predictive ability between Poisson regression and SARIMA models, and investigates the possibility of developing an empirical forecast system using time-series models for cryptosporidiosis in Brisbane, Australia.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\n# Study Area\\n\\nBrisbane, the capital of Queensland State, is a subtropical city situated on the eastern coast of Australia and covers approximately 1326 km2. The population size was 883,449 on June 30, 2001. Brisbane was chosen as the main research site due to its high population density and significant public health implications regarding cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\n# Data Collection\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis has been notifiable in Queensland since 1996. Data on notified cryptosporidiosis cases in Brisbane from 1996 to 2004 were obtained from the Queensland Department of Health.

Monthly weather parameters were used due to low incidence rates at weekly or daily scales.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\nSimple analyses were conducted for each independent variable. Cross-correlations were computed between weather variables and cryptosporidiosis incidence over various time lags. A time series Poisson model was adopted to control for seasonality and trends, and a SARIMA model was also utilized to account for seasonal variations.\\n---\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis research paper investigates the relationship between weather variability and the incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

AEP Vol. 17, No. 9 September 2007: 679–688\\n\\n# Predictive Validity of the Models\\n\\nThe predictive validity of the models was evaluated by using the AIC, which measures how well the model fits the series. The AIC is calculated as:\\n\\nAIC = n * ln(residual sum of squares/n) + 2k\\n\\nwhere “n” is the number of observations, “ln” is the natural logarithm, and “k” is the number of parameters being estimated. The root mean square error (RMSE) for both models was also assessed. The smaller the RMSE, the better the model in terms of the ability to forecast over this period. The RMSE is equal to the square root of the mean of the differences between true and predicted values. The RMSE is a valid indicator of relative model quality including GLMs. These results were further validated through a plot of time series on the cumulative sums of actual and predicted values for the two models.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Descriptive Analysis\\n\\nTable 1 shows the summary statistics for each variable. The monthly mean incidence rate of cryptosporidiosis, maximum temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity was:\\n\\n- Incidence Rate: 1.45/100,000\\n- Maximum Temperature: 26.40 °C\\n- Total Rainfall: 76.82 mm\\n- Relative Humidity: 51.87%\\n\\nThese statistics were recorded between 1996 and 2004 in Brisbane. The incidence rate of cryptosporidiosis showed striking variation, with the highest number of cases in February 2002 (178 cases; incidence rate: 20.12/100,000). The large peaks of cryptosporidiosis generally coincide with high temperature and high relative humidity events.\\n\\n# Cross-correlation Function\\n\\nThe results of the cross-correlations adjusted for seasonality show that the incidence of cryptosporidiosis was significantly associated with maximum temperature at lags of up to 2 months and relative humidity at a lag of 1 month. However, there was no significant association between minimum temperature, rainfall, and cryptosporidiosis transmission in any lag.\\n\\n# Table 1.

However, the residual analyses indicated that there remained a significant autocorrelation at a lag of 1 month that could not be adequately accommodated in the model.\\n\\n# SARIMA Model\\n\\nThe SARIMA models show that auto-regression, first-order seasonal autoregression, second-order seasonal autoregression, and monthly maximum temperature at a prior moving average of 1 to 3 months were significantly associated with cryptosporidiosis transmission. The model estimated with the weather variables was a better fit than the model without these variables, in terms of smaller values of AIC.\\n\\n# Comparison of Time Series Poisson Regression and SARIMA Models\\n\\nThe nature and magnitude of the effect estimates were similar for the two methods used in this study. Both Poisson regression and SARIMA models show that monthly maximum temperature at a prior moving average of 1 to 3 months was significantly associated with cryptosporidiosis disease. These models were used to predict the transmission of cryptosporidiosis disease in Brisbane between January and December 2004.\\n---\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.chart {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Volume 17, Number 9\\n\\n# September 2007: 679–688\\n\\nFigure 2.

The validation analyses indicate that the two models had reasonable accuracy over the predictive period, but the SARIMA model (RMSE: 0.40; AIC: 12.53) had slightly greater predictive capability than the Poisson regression model (RMSE: 0.54; AIC: 2.84). Moreover, the analysis of residuals shows that the time series Poisson regression appeared to violate the modeling assumption in that it did not capture all of the residual autocorrelation. Therefore, the SARIMA model seemed a better fit than the Poisson regression model in the assessment of the relationship between the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and weather variability.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe results of this study suggest that weather variability (particularly maximum temperature) may have played a significant role in the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in Brisbane either directly or through other unmeasured variables. The key determinants of the cryptosporidiosis transmission observed in this analysis included maximum temperature at lags of 1 to 3 months and relative humidity at a lag of 1 month. We obtained similar results from two different time series models: SARIMA and Poisson regression. Both methods show a clear association between weather variables and cryptosporidiosis disease. However, we found that the SARIMA time series model allowed for a more complex description of the seasonality and autocorrelation structure of the series and appeared to be more suitable in the assessment of the relationship between the weather variables and transmission of cryptosporidiosis than the Poisson regression model, with respect to goodness of fit, conformance with assumptions, and predictive accuracy.\\n\\n# Table 3.

A Poisson regression model is usually used for describing the rate of some health outcomes, especially those with a lower probability of distribution. Time series Poisson regression models have gained popularity for the analysis of time series data in medical and public health research, because many biological phenomena are well described by a Poisson distribution. The interpretation of the results from a regression model is more straightforward for the epidemiologists in terms of relative risk estimates. However, one key assumption of Poisson regression is that outcomes should be independent. It is flawed to assume that counts of infectious disease occurring over time are uncorrelated. On the other hand, characterizing this autocorrelation can be difficult since the transmissibility of infectious disease varies substantially and the seasonality patterns may be quite complex. Therefore, the application of Poisson regression models in analyzing time series infectious disease data, without careful adjustment for autocorrelation, seasonality, and trends, may need to be re-evaluated. The study of Tobias et al. shows that the Poisson regression model cannot control adequately for autocorrelation of an outcome measure and is likely to underestimate the variance of the estimates.\\n\\nAn alternative description of seasonal variation is to assume a sinusoidal curve with a period of 1 year. Harmonic regression is a linear regression model in which the predictor variables are trigonometric functions of a time-related variable. Harmonic seasonal factors (sinusoidal term (sin(2 * month/12) + cos(2 * month/12))) may be used to control for seasonality for comparison. This approach is used in modeling biological phenomena, which tends to exhibit periodic rhythms. However, in this study, the inferences arising from these different regression methods did not show any significant difference in modeling outcomes.\\n\\nThe SARIMA model has been promoted as the statistical method of choice in the case of data arising from observations collected over long periods of time. It has several advantages compared with the Poisson regression model, in particular, its forecasting capability and its richer information on time-related changes. SARIMA modeling is useful for interpreting and applying surveillance data in disease control and prevention. As in many epidemiological infectious disease time series, the data show seasonal pattern and trend components. The chosen SARIMA models fit the observations well; none of the series shows residuals that differ significantly from a zero.\\n---\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n\\n# Weather Variability and Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Volume 17, No. 9\\n\\n# September 2007: 679–688\\n\\nA, Autocorrelation of Poisson regression model.

Once a satisfactory model has been obtained, it can be used to forecast expected numbers of cases for any given number of future time intervals. However, one of the most important disadvantages of this approach is the necessity of a large amount of data (i.e., a minimum of 50 observations) to build a reasonable SARIMA model. The second disadvantage is that the SARIMA models were based on the assumption of normality. For less frequently occurring diseases, the normality assumption, even after a logarithmic or square root transformation, may be more questionable. For example, rare diseases may have small counts and periods with no case occurrence, in which case the SARIMA model may be inappropriate. A SARIMA model with Poisson likelihood may be more appropriate, but such a software package is not yet available.\\n\\nWeather influences the abundance and ecology of Cryptosporidium parvum, which is naturally present in the environment. C. parvum thrives in warm waters of moderate salinity and is closely associated with aquatic invertebrates. Therefore, with changing weather patterns, the geographic range of these pathogens may also change, potentially resulting in increased exposure and risk of infection for humans. Severe weather events appear to be correlated with enteric diseases, such as outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in hot summers in Brisbane and South Sydney, Australia.

Lagged effects may be related to the combination of the incubation period of cryptosporidiosis (2–12 days) and certain delays in disease reporting (a few weeks).\\n\\nThis study has two major strengths. First, to our knowledge, this is the first time series study to examine the relationship between major weather variables and cryptosporidiosis transmission in a subtropical metropolitan area. Our data demonstrate that maximum temperature and relative humidity were associated with cryptosporidiosis transmission in Brisbane. Second, we compared two common time series analysis methods and found that a SARIMA time series forecasting model appeared to be more suitable than Poisson regression model in the assessment of the relationship between the transmission of cryptosporidiosis and weather variables.\\n\\n# Limitations\\n\\nLimitations of this study should also be acknowledged. First, the occurrence of cryptosporidiosis is complex. Cryptosporidiosis disease is not only influenced by weather, but by many other biological, social, and environmental factors. Second, the study only focused on Brisbane in Australia. The results must be generalized with caution as the situation in other areas may differ.\\n\\n# Future Implications\\n\\nIt is estimated that global warming will cause temperatures to rise 1°C to 6°C by 2070 in Brisbane, Australia. Assuming that a sustained temperature rise has a similar effect on monthly temperature variations, then the occurrence of cryptosporidiosis disease may rise 50 to 300 cases annually. Public health authorities need to make concerted efforts to monitor and control cryptosporidiosis disease. The findings of this study may assist local public health authorities to utilize the model developed in this study to identify the communities that require particular attention and to mobilize limited resources to effectively control and prevent outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis during epidemic seasons. These findings may have applications as a decision support tool in planning disease control and risk-management programs.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank the Queensland Department of Health, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and Australian Bureau of Statistics for providing the data on notified cryptosporidiosis cases, climate, and population growth, respectively.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between various weather-related variables and the occurrence and concentration of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in fresh surface waters. We implemented a comprehensive search in four databases, screened 1,228 unique citations for relevance, extracted data from 107 relevant articles, and conducted random-effects meta-analysis on 16 key relationships. The average odds of identifying Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in fresh surface waters was 2.61 (95% CI = 1.63–4.21; I² = 16%) and 2.87 (95% CI = 1.76–4.67; I² = 0%) times higher, respectively, during and after extreme weather events compared to baseline conditions. Similarly, the average concentration of Cryptosporidium and Giardia identified under these conditions was also higher, by approximately 4.38 oocysts/100 L (95% CI = 2.01–9.54; I² = 0%) and 2.68 cysts/100 L (95% CI = 1.08–6.55; I² = 48%). Correlation relationships between other weather-related parameters and the density of these pathogens were frequently heterogeneous and indicated low to moderate effects. Meta-regression analyses identified different study-level factors that influenced the variability in these relationships. The results can be used as direct inputs for quantitative microbial risk assessment. Future research is warranted to investigate these effects and potential mitigation strategies in different settings and contexts.\\n\\n# Key Words\\n\\nclimate change, Cryptosporidium, drinking water, Giardia, meta-analysis, systematic review\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nGlobal climate change is expected to impact water quality through multiple processes, including gradual temperature increases, changes in seasonal and weather patterns, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as excess rainfall, floods, and droughts (Ebi et al. 2006; Semenza et al. 2012a; Cann et al. 2013; Schijven 2006; King & Monis 2007; Lal et al. 2013). The protozoan pathogens Cryptosporidium and Giardia are particularly sensitive to these changes due to their environmentally mediated life cycle (Lal et al. 2013). Characteristics of these pathogens such as their prolonged survival in the environment, transmission through drinking and recreational water sources, resistance to chlorine disinfection, and low infectious dose contribute to their significant health threat, especially in vulnerable populations such as the immunocompromised (Savioli et al. 2006).\\n\\nSporadic cases and outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis have been linked to various weather-related factors that may be affected by climate change (MacKenzie et al. 1994; Curriero et al. 2001; Thomas et al. 2006; Jagai et al. 2013).\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-align: justify;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\n# Authors: I. Young et al.\\n\\nJournal of Water and Health | 13.1 | 2015\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nRecent systematic reviews have indicated a consistent seasonal increase in cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in temperate, developed countries during the summer months. A meta-analysis of global cryptosporidiosis cases has identified an increased incidence associated with seasonal air temperature and precipitation patterns. These associations may be influenced by various ecological processes, including prolonged seasonal periods suitable for (oo)cyst transmission and increased contamination of drinking water sources due to excess rainfall and stormwater runoff, which could also compromise the efficacy of water treatment plant filtration and disinfection measures.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nQuantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models can characterize and predict the risks of illness due to Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and other pathogens under various climate change scenarios. In Canada, a predictive modeling framework has been developed to project the potential effects of climate change and adaptation measures on food and water safety. One case study estimated risks from climate change impacts on Cryptosporidium and Giardia contamination of drinking water in a northern community. Structured and transparent knowledge synthesis methods can inform the driving relationships in this model with credible and robust inputs regarding the potential impact of climate change on these pathogens.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Review Question and Scope\\n\\nThe systematic review was conducted in accordance with a protocol developed a priori, detailing the review methods and procedures. The review question was: “What are the relationships between extreme weather events and other key weather-related variables and the occurrence and density of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in fresh surface waters?” This review was one of two complementary systematic reviews to inform QMRA model case studies considered during the development of a risk modeling framework.\\n\\n# Search Strategy\\n\\nA search algorithm was developed by extracting key terms from the titles and abstracts of ten potentially relevant articles identified a priori. Terms were combined in a reproducible search algorithm that was pre-tested in Scopus.\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\n#\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nAuthors: I.

Young et al. | Journal of Water and Health | 13.1 | 2015\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis systematic review examines the impact of extreme weather events on the prevalence and concentration of protozoan contaminants, specifically Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts, in freshwater systems. A total of four meta-analyses were conducted to analyze prevalence and concentration data subsets, reflecting the differences in occurrence and density of these pathogens during extreme weather conditions compared to baseline conditions.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nPrevalence data were extracted in a 2 × 2 table format, and meta-analysis was conducted on the odds ratio (OR) effect measure. Concentration data were analyzed as a raw mean difference (MD) in protozoan counts. A total of 12 meta-analyses were also conducted on Spearman rank and Pearson correlations reflecting associations between the density of Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia cysts and various weather-related variables.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nAll meta-analysis models were developed using the DerSimonian and Laird method. The models did not account for the extra level of variation due to some comparisons being clustered within articles. To meet normality assumptions, ORs and MDs were converted to the natural logarithm scale for analysis. For prevalence data, zero values were replaced with a standard continuity correction of 0.5 prior to analysis.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nFor concentration data, Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were not detected in 20% and 25% of observations, respectively. A constant value was added to these datasets before logarithmic transformation to allow inclusion of all comparisons. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to compare findings with and without zero counts.\\n\\n# Heterogeneity Assessment\\n\\nHeterogeneity in the meta-analyses was assessed using the Q statistic chi-squared test and I². A sign test was applied to determine the consistency of relationships, with P < 0.05 indicating a significant direction of effect. Publication bias was tested using Begg’s adjusted rank correlation and Egger’s regression tests.\\n\\n# Meta-regression\\n\\nMeta-regression was conducted on meta-analysis data subsets to explore possible sources of heterogeneity in the effect estimates across studies.\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nI. Young et al. | Journal of Water and Health | 13.1 | 2015\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nFollowing nine pre-specified variables were evaluated as potential covariates in meta-regression models: article type (journal article vs. other); publication year (continuous); study region (North America vs. other); study design (cross sectional vs. longitudinal); water source type (river/stream waters vs. lake/reservoir/other); water sampling location (municipal/multiple locations vs. open water source/watershed); use of the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1622 or 1623 (yes vs. no) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (yes vs. no) to identify protozoa; and whether any quantitative outcomes were insufficiently reported to allow for potential meta-analysis (yes vs. no). For meta-analyses of relationships with extreme weather events, an additional dichotomous variable representing the criteria for an ‘extreme weather event’ (excess water flow vs. excess precipitation-based/other) was created and evaluated. In addition, a dichotomous variable representing the correlation method (Spearman vs. Pearson) was created and evaluated in analyses with correlation coefficient outcomes. Given the limited number of observations in each meta-analysis subset, all covariates except publication year were modelled as dichotomous variables, and only univariable meta-regression models were evaluated. For each data subset, Spearman rank correlations were used to evaluate collinearity between covariates prior to conducting meta-regression; if evidence of collinearity was identified (ρ &gt; 0.8), only one of the correlated variables was selected and considered for meta-regression based on its biological relevance. Covariates were considered significant if 95% confidence intervals (CI) excluded the null. Meta-regression was conducted using Stata 10.\\n\\n# Quality-of-evidence Assessment\\n\\nEach meta-analysis data subset was assessed for its overall quality-of-evidence using a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration’s Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (Guyatt et al. 2011; Higgins & Green 2011; Wilhelm et al. 2012). We used an adapted version of the GRADE approach reported by Wilhelm et al. (2012), which included an assessment of each of the following five criteria: individual study risk-of-bias and reporting criteria; inconsistency of direction of findings; imprecision of effect estimates; indirectness of individual study measurements; and risk of publication bias. In contrast to the Cochrane Collaboration’s recommended approach for intervention research, we did not employ automatic downgrading of observational study designs (nor did we consider potential upgrading of evidence) given the nature of the review question and focus and because all included research was observational (Guyatt et al. 2011; Higgins & Green 2011; Wilhelm et al. 2012). Datasets started with four points, and points were deducted based on the criteria described in Table 1. The final GRADE rating corresponded to the remaining number of points: one = very low; two = low; three = moderate; four = high.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Characteristics of Relevant Articles\\n\\nA total of 1,228 unique citations were identified and screened for relevance, of which 165 were procured and characterized, and 107 were confirmed as relevant (Figure 1). The characteristics of the relevant articles are shown in Table 2, and a citation list of these articles is available as Supplementary material (available online at http://www.iwaponline.com/wh/013/079.pdf). The median publication year among relevant articles was 2006 (range 1988–2013). Most of the 107 relevant articles reported on observational studies conducted in North America (37%) and that used a longitudinal sampling design (71%). The risk-of-bias and reporting criteria of the 107 relevant articles are shown in Table 3. Most relevant articles sufficiently reported their sampling methods and procedures (90%), but nearly 70% reported at least some of their quantitative outcomes in a format insufficient for extraction and potential use in meta-analysis (Table 3).\\n\\n# Meta-analysis Results\\n\\nThe meta-analysis results are shown in Table 4.

The forest plots of the individual study and average estimates of effect for these four relationships are shown in Figures 2–5. Heterogeneity was low and non-significant for both prevalence relationships and for the Cryptosporidium–concentration relationship (Table 4), all of which received a moderate GRADE rating. For the association between extreme weather events and Giardia concentration, although a consistent, positive direction of effect was identified, the relationship was heterogeneous (I2 = 48%) and the GRADE rating was low. A sensitivity analysis of the concentration data meta-analyses indicated small changes (&lt;20%) in the effect estimates with a slightly larger MD when comparisons with zero values were excluded.\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nAuthors: I.

For example, similar findings were found among the studies even though study criteria for extreme weather events were based on various levels of increases in water flow rate, depth, and precipitation accumulation, and sampling occurrences ranged from throughout, during the peak, and immediately after the event.\\n\\nIn contrast to these findings, no consistent correlations were identified between precipitation totals within 24 and 72 h of sampling and either pathogen, except for a weak correlation between the latter and Cryptosporidium density across three studies. This suggests that rainfall accumulation alone is not a reliable indicator of the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts or Giardia cysts in fresh water sources, and a threshold level likely must be exceeded before precipitation has an appreciable impact on these pathogens.\\n\\nFurther research is warranted to investigate the prevalence and concentration of these pathogens in fresh surface waters under varying extreme weather conditions and in different locations and contexts.\\n\\nA small, positive correlation was identified between water turbidity and flow rate and Cryptosporidium density, with a weaker association identified between each variable and Giardia densities. Increasing water turbidity and flow rates can result in increased protozoan densities due to particle association and aggregation and the re-suspension of (oo)cysts from water sediments.\\n\\nResearch also indicates that while (oo)cysts can survive and maintain their infectivity in low temperature conditions, they are highly susceptible to increasing environmental temperatures. However, although we found a weak, negative correlation between water temperature and Giardia densities, we did not identify a consistent relationship between water temperature and Cryptosporidium or between air temperature and either pathogen.'),\n",

Each of these relationships should be considered context-specific and is likely affected by several meteorological, temporal, hydrological, and geographic factors, as well as methodological differences among studies.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Weather-related Variables and Cryptosporidium and Giardia\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\ncaption {\\nfont-weight: bold;\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Summary of Meta-analyses of Relationships Between Selected Weather-related Variables and Cryptosporidium and Giardia in Fresh Surface Waters\\n\\n**Table 4**\\n|Outcome/relationship|No. of comparisons (articles)|Q test P-value|I2a|Average estimate of effect (95% CI)b|Sign test direction of effect (P-value)|Egger’s (Begg’s) pub. bias test P-value|GRADE ratingc|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cryptosporidium Extreme weather events – prevalence|13 (8)|0.284|15.8%|OR = 2.61 (1.63, 4.21)|Positive (0.003)|0.192 (0.669)|Moderate|\\n|Cryptosporidium Extreme weather events – concentration|15 (6)|0.527|0%|MD = 4.38 (2.01, 9.54)|Positive (0.006)|0.574 (1.000)|Moderate|\\n|Cryptosporidium Air temperature – correlation|4 (4)|0.002|80.5%|N/a|No association (0.500)|N/a|Very low|\\n|Cryptosporidium Water temperature – correlation|16 (15)|<0.001|83.0%|N/a|No association (0.244)|N/a|Very low|\\n|Cryptosporidium Water turbidity – correlation|40 (33)|<0.001|82.1%|r = 0.37 (0.27, 0.46)|Positive (<0.001)|N/a|Low|\\n|Cryptosporidium Water flow rate – correlation|14 (11)|<0.001|73.2%|r = 0.35 (0.24, 0.46)|Positive (0.002)|N/a|Low|\\n|Cryptosporidium Precipitation (24 h prior) – correlation|5 (5)|0.227|29.1%|r = 0.01 (0.09, 0.07)|No association (0.625)|N/a|Low|\\n|Cryptosporidium Precipitation (72 h prior) – correlation|3 (3)|0.781|0%|r = 0.18 (0.23, 0.12)|No association (0.250)|N/a|Moderate|\\n|Giardia Extreme weather events – prevalence|8 (4)|0.675|0%|OR = 2.87 (1.76, 4.67)|Positive (0.008)|N/a|Moderate|\\n|Giardia Extreme weather events – concentration|12 (4)|0.032|47.8%|MD = 2.68 (1.08, 6.55)|Positive (0.032)|N/a|Low|\\n|Giardia Air temperature – correlation|4 (4)|0.078|55.9%|N/a|No association (0.750)|N/a|Very low|\\n|Giardia Water temperature – correlation|14 (13)|<0.001|79.6%|r = 0.27 (0.42, 0.12)|Negative (0.011)|N/a|Low|\\n|Giardia Water turbidity – correlation|35 (28)|<0.001|78.4%|r = 0.22 (0.11, 0.32)|Positive (0.011)|N/a|Low|\\n|Giardia Water flow rate – correlation|14 (11)|0.155|28.0%|r = 0.19 (0.12, 0.26)|Positive (0.044)|0.755 (0.783)|Moderate|\\n|Giardia Precipitation (24 h prior) – correlation|7 (7)|0.001|74.3%|N/a|No association (0.328)|N/a|Very low|\\n|Giardia Precipitation (72 h prior) – correlation|4 (4)|<0.001|90.5%|N/a|No association (0.500)|N/a|Very low|\\n\\nCI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio; MD = mean difference; N/a = not applicable.\\n\\na I2 refers to the percentage of variation in effect estimates across study comparisons that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error.\\n\\nb Reported estimates of effect have been back-transformed to their original scale: OR for prevalence data, MD in (oo)cysts/100 L for concentration data, and r for correlation data.

Many studies that sampled in municipal locations investigated pathogens in combined sewer overflows and other urban waterways, which can be heavily contaminated from untreated sewage and stormwater discharges during extreme weather events (Gibson III et al. 1998; Arnone & Walling 2006; Schets et al. 2008; Duris et al. 2013). It is possible that these relationships are more pronounced in these situations. In contrast, many open source watersheds are influenced by mixed geographic and land use factors with many non-point sources of contamination (Wilkes et al.).\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nAuthors: I.

CI = confidence interval.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe average correlation between water turbidity and Giardia density across study comparisons also differed depending on the article publication type, with positive correlations more likely to be reported in journal articles compared to other documents (e.g., reports and theses). This may reflect a publication bias effect, similar to that reported in the health sector, where a systematic review found that clinical trials reporting positive and significant results were more likely to be published in peer-reviewed journals than studies reporting negative or non-significant findings (Hopewell et al. 2009). This finding underscores the importance of including gray literature documents in systematic reviews to ensure a more accurate representation of the overall state of evidence on a topic.\\n\\nHeterogeneity in the correlation between water turbidity and Cryptosporidium density was partially explained by the reported use of US EPA Methods 1622 or 1623 to detect the protozoa compared to other approaches. These methods are the most widely recognized and used approaches for detecting Cryptosporidium and Giardia in surface waters (US EPA 2005a, 2005b; Yang et al. 2008; Health Canada 2012). Other approaches have been shown to have lower recovery efficiencies and increased variability compared to the US EPA methods (Quintero-Betancourt et al. 2002); however, the EPA methods also have limitations with variable recovery efficiencies, they cannot determine host species of origin or the viability or infectivity of (oo)cysts, and there are logistical challenges when implementing these methods.\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nAuthors: I.

Articles that reported at least some of their quantitative outcome data in formats insufficient for extraction and potential use in meta-analysis were more likely to report stronger correlations between water flow rate and Cryptosporidium densities and between water temperature and both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. This finding might reflect a selective outcome reporting bias, meaning that authors of these studies could have selectively omitted some of their results due to a lack of statistical significance, lack of perceived importance, or for other reasons.\\n\\nTherefore, reported meta-analyses for the above relationships may have overestimated the average correlation, and the results should be interpreted with caution.

Young et al.\\n\\nJournal of Water and Health | 13.1 | 2015\\n\\nSurveillance of these pathogens is warranted during and after extreme weather events in order to reliably determine risks of contamination. However, given the time delay between protozoan sampling and laboratory detection, early warning systems and QMRA modeling are also necessary to facilitate the rapid identification and assessment of increased risks of drinking water contamination with Cryptosporidium and Giardia and to ensure that effective and timely risk mitigation strategies can be implemented. The results of this study can inform these types of preventive approaches.\\n\\nA holistic and multi-barrier approach should be followed to prevent and mitigate the potential impacts of climate change on Cryptosporidium and Giardia contamination of fresh surface waters (Health Canada 2012). This should include enhanced watershed protection against the effects of increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events. For example, vegetated and grassland buffers have been shown to be an effective approach to reducing Cryptosporidium contamination of surface water sources from agricultural runoff (Tate et al. 2004; Atwill et al. 2006).\\n\\nImprovements to stormwater management and the infrastructure and capacity of drinking water facilities could also mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events, particularly for smaller systems with inadequate filtration and disinfection measures. Other risk mitigation strategies could include limiting the uptake of surface water, issuing boil-water advisories, or using additional barriers (e.g., enhanced filtration or treatment) during and immediately after extreme weather events (Health Canada 2012). Further evaluation of these and other mitigation and adaptation strategies is warranted (Smith et al. in press).\\n\\nIt is possible that some potentially relevant articles were not included in this review because they were not indexed within the bibliographic databases included in our initial search. Moreover, a more comprehensive search of additional sources of gray literature (e.g., using search engines such as Google or by contacting and searching the websites of targeted organizations) could have yielded additional data. We attempted to minimize this potential bias through our search verification strategy of hand-searching the reference lists of a selection of relevant articles and reviews. A related limitation is that we were only able to review articles in English, French, and Spanish languages. The impact of excluding a small number (n = 9) of potentially relevant articles in other languages is unknown.\\n\\nMeta-analyses were based on data from all identified species of Cryptosporidium and Giardia. However, previous studies have found that the majority of identified (oo)cysts in fresh water sources are non-viable and non-infectious to humans (Yang et al. 2008; Van Dyke et al. 2012), and it is unknown whether the relationships characterized in this review would also apply similarly to viable and infectious species. Increased application of PCR-based and molecular detection methods is necessary in future research to differentiate pathogenic from non-pathogenic species and to aid in tracking sources of contamination. In addition, most analyses were based on a small number of comparisons, and several were significantly heterogeneous; therefore, our results should be interpreted appropriately. It is possible that some of the significant covariates in meta-regression analyses could reflect spurious findings, or conversely, that some included variables were not identified as significant due to low power. The dynamics of each relationship investigated in this review are also likely related to other, site-specific factors that might not have been measured or accounted for in the meta-regression models (Atherholt et al. 1998; Kistemann et al. 2002; McGuire et al. 2002; Wilkes et al. 2011).\\n\\nOne of the primary aims of this study was to identify and synthesize data on the relationships between extreme weather events and other weather-related variables and the occurrence and concentration of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in fresh surface waters to inform QMRA models. Reported MDs and ORs (converted to relative risk ratios) from meta-analysis can be integrated into QMRAs alongside other model elements (e.g., initial levels of protozoan contamination, use of water treatments and interventions, and population vulnerabilities) to evaluate the impact of extreme weather events on surface water contamination, and consequently, public health. Changes to frequencies of extreme weather events as projected by climate change models can be simulated to estimate the relative impacts of climate change on public health compared to historic or current conditions (Smith et al. in press).\\n---\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Systematic Review of Weather Effects on Protozoan Contamination of Fresh Water\\n\\nAuthors: I.

Here, we review seasonal patterns across five enteric zoonotic diseases: campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, vero-cytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC), cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in the context of two primary drivers of seasonality: (i) environmental effects on pathogen occurrence and pathogen-host associations and (ii) population characteristics/behaviour.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We systematically reviewed published literature from 1960–2010, resulting in the review of 86 studies across the five diseases. The Gini coefficient compared temporal variations in incidence across diseases and the monthly seasonality index characterised timing of seasonal peaks. Consistent seasonal patterns across transnational boundaries, albeit with regional variations was observed. The bacterial diseases all had a distinct summer peak, with identical Gini values for campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis (0.22) and a higher index for VTEC (Gini = 0.36). Cryptosporidiosis displayed a bi-modal peak with spring and summer highs and the most marked temporal variation (Gini = 0.39). Giardiasis showed a relatively small summer increase and was the least variable (Gini = 0.18).\\n\\nConclusions/Significance: Seasonal variation in enteric zoonotic diseases is ubiquitous, with regional variations highlighting complex environment-pathogen-host interactions. Results suggest that proximal environmental influences and host population dynamics, together with distal, longer-term climatic variability could have important direct and indirect consequences for future enteric disease risk. Additional understanding of the concerted influence of these factors on disease patterns may improve assessment and prediction of enteric disease burden in temperate, developed countries.\\n\\nCitation: Lal A, Hales S, French N, Baker MG (2012) Seasonality in Human Zoonotic Enteric Diseases: A Systematic Review.

Zoonoses, defined here as those diseases with predominantly animal reservoirs, can cause high morbidity in healthy adults [3] and more serious outcomes in susceptible populations [4,5]. In temperate, developed countries these diseases exhibit patterns associated with weather and display seasonal peaks alternating with low background levels of infection [6,7]. The bacterial diseases, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and VTEC, peak in summer and decrease in winter [8,9,10]. Among protozoan diseases, cryptosporidiosis has a definite seasonality, with spring peaks reported in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and summer-autumn peaks in the United States and Canada [11,12,13]. In contrast, giardiasis is markedly less seasonal, albeit with an early autumn peak in some countries [14]. Such regular, recurring patterns indicate a strong, direct, environmental influence on pathogen epidemiology [15], pathogen reservoirs and transmission pathways [16,17] or factors that affect frequency of pathogen-host interactions [18]. However, such patterns have also been attributed to population characteristics such as seasonal farming [19] and recreational activities [20], mobility patterns [21] and periodic changes in host susceptibility to infection [22]. Thus, large scale environmental influences and associated host demographics are predicted to strongly determine future enteric disease incidence through their effect on host pathogen load, transmission opportunities and spread [23,24]. To further our understanding of the putative environmental and population associated mechanisms driving enteric disease seasonality, it is helpful to compare seasonal patterns across diseases and regions.\\n\\nTo date, international comparisons of enteric zoonotic diseases have been restricted to a single disease [25,26] or pathogen groups [27], associations with weather variables [28,29], other specific risk factors [30], outbreaks [31] or the burden of non-pathogen specific diarrhoeal disease [32,33]. Multi-pathogen studies are generally limited to detailed analyses of regional data (e.g. [2,34]). To our knowledge, there exists no compiled evidence documenting seasonality across enteric zoonotic diseases in temperate, developed countries. Such a cross-country, multi-disease approach may be especially informative when integrating potent trans-boundary issues such as human health, population migration and ecological change.\\n---\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 2em;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 1.5em;\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\nOur review focuses on environmentally mediated, enteric diseases with predominantly zoonotic (nonhuman) reservoirs; group III b in Eisenberg’s et al. [35] classification of infectious diseases based on dominant transmission pathways, hereafter referred to as enteric zoonotic diseases. By restricting our review to regions governed by similar climate mechanisms, comparisons of seasonal patterns across countries may facilitate identification of environmental and population influences underlying seasonal variations in disease incidence [36]. Consequently, we confine our study to temperate regions. It is equally important to also account for dominant non-climatic differences among countries that may mask seasonal patterns [37]. We attempt this by limiting our review to OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) member states; countries that have relatively similar economies, public health infrastructure, population dynamics and disease reporting standards.\\n\\nWe assess seasonal patterns in important human enteric zoonotic diseases, notably campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, VTEC (Vero-cytotoxigenic Escherichia coli), cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis among temperate, developed countries and discuss our results in the context of how these patterns could be driven by environmental influences and population characteristics. Specifically, we use a systematic review of the literature and statistical summaries of temporal distribution to establish: (i) the existence (or absence) of a consistent pattern of disease incidence and quantify the overall magnitude of temporal inequality for each pathogen; and, (ii) compare monthly disease patterns among regions by applying a seasonality index.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Systematic Review'),\n",

The five diseases chosen for review were based on Eisenberg’s et al. [35] classification of infectious diseases based on dominant transmission pathways. We focused on environmentally mediated, enteric diseases with predominantly zoonotic (nonhuman) reservoirs; group III b in the classification. Using three electronic databases, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, we searched publications across the 1960–2010 period that quantified the temporal patterns of campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, VTEC, cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in humans. The keywords used were: (“season”, “seasonality”, “temporal”), AND (“campylobacteriosis”, “campylobacter”, “salmonellosis”, “salmonella”, “VTEC”, “STEC”, “cryptosporidiosis”, “cryptosporidium”, “giardiasis”, “giardia”). No language or database restrictions were imposed on the searches. For each disease, citations resulting from the database searches were exported into a master library, and duplicates removed based on parameters of identical author, date and title. Full-text versions of the articles that fulfilled our eligibility criteria were obtained and their reference lists were manually searched to identify any further relevant manuscripts. We also examined the bibliographies of reviews published on pathogen specific epidemiology to identify additional sources for inclusion in the analysis.\\n\\nStudy selection. Screening of articles for eligibility consisted of two steps. The first step aimed to exclude papers not relevant to the review and consisted of (i) identifying papers where research was conducted in non-OECD or tropical regions or polar regions (studies conducted outside of 23.5°N–66.5°N and 23.5°S–66.5°S) and, (ii) assessing the residual citations using the question “Does the title, and/or abstract and text explicitly describe data relating to the temporal and/or seasonal variation in the disease of interest in humans?” (adapted from [38]). Here, an explicit description of seasonal variation consisted of text and/or graphics documenting the number or percentage of cases or incidence rates over the study duration.\\n\\nThe second stage involved critically evaluating the studies using the following a priori established criteria. Studies were included if (i) they had been conducted continuously for a minimum of a full year to cover all seasons, (ii) the primary outcome was a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of the enteric pathogen of interest, (iii) the study reported case data temporally (day, week, month) (iv) the study was written in English and published in a peer reviewed journal and, (v) study design did not include intervention trials.\\n\\nStudies that satisfied the inclusion conditions but failed to be representative of the general population were excluded. These comprised studies that were (i) conducted in institutions (e.g. day-care centres, rest homes), (ii) directed at specific demographic groups (e.g. children, elderly) and groups with certain characteristics (immune-compromised, travellers), (iii) studies focused solely on outbreaks as these studies were generally of a shorter duration and can reflect disease patterns that may not be typical of disease seasonality generally, (iv) studies looking at broader gastro-enteric outcomes (GI) or infectious intestinal disease (IID), (v) studies focused on the microbiological and immunological characteristics and molecular ecology of the pathogen, (vi) clinical studies, (vi) review articles, although these were used as a source for additional papers.\\n\\nAll data used here were taken from the papers, either directly from the tables or extracted from graphs using DigitizeIt software e.g. [39] or in four cases, by contacting authors. For each pathogen, the relevant studies were examined in detail and the following information recorded: authors and year of publication, location and study duration, study design and sample size, temporal resolution of case data, age range of population, and the timing of the peak number of cases reported.\\n\\n# Quantitative data synthesis.\\n\\nBased on geographical and political boundaries studies were assigned to the following regions: United Kingdom (UK) which includes Ireland, Scotland and Wales, Continental Europe which includes studies in mainland Europe, North America (USA), Canada, Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), and the Asian region. As a majority of the data came from countries in the northern hemisphere, data from the southern hemisphere countries were adjusted by six months for the opposite season (i.e. January in the northern hemisphere was aligned with July in the southern hemisphere) [25]. Seasons were defined based on their occurrence in the Northern hemisphere: Winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-November).\\n\\nWe assessed disease patterns using the Gini index and a monthly seasonality index. Study-specific monthly averages were obtained by dividing the total number of cases for each month by the number of relevant months in the study. For example, to calculate the average for January over January 1992- December 1995, we took the number of cases in each month, added them together and divided by the number of relevant months in the study (in this case, four). Next, we calculated an annual average for each study by dividing by the number of monthly averages (e.g. January average + February average …/12 = annual average). Study-specific monthly averages were divided by the annual average and thus converted to proportions (e.g. January average/annual average = January proportion) [40]. These proportions were used for the calculation of the Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient and the monthly seasonality index.\\n\\nLorenz curve and Gini coefficient. In order to characterize seasonality for each disease we developed Lorenz curve models [41] for each disease and determined the corresponding Gini coefficients [42]. In this study, the Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of disease cases across the months of the year.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org | April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e31883\\n---\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.table th, .table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.table th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\n# Representation of Disease Incidence\\n\\nThe representation of the cumulative distribution of disease incidence as a function of the proportion of the year is crucial for understanding seasonal patterns.

The UK and Canada peaked first in July and Europe in August (Figure 4c). The US also showed a slight peak in summer (July), but a dominant peak in autumn (September). While North America, Canada, and the UK showed a decrease in winter, Europe remained above the overall average for autumn-winter (October-January).\\n\\n# Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nThe overall monthly index for cryptosporidium indicated a clear bi-modal peak, in spring (April) and late summer-early autumn (August-September), with the latter being considerably larger (Figure 3d). Separately, all countries considered here had one major peak (Figure 4d). The adjusted incidence in Oceanic countries (Australia, New Zealand) together with the UK exhibited a strong spring peak (April) with an additional second smaller autumn peak (September) shown by the Oceanic countries. North America, Canada, and the rest of Europe displayed a late summer peak, with Canada showing a small spring peak. In all countries represented, the lowest number of cases was recorded in winter.\\n\\n# Giardiasis\\n\\nThe monthly seasonality index for giardia showed a small summer peak (Figure 3e). Here, Oceania, Europe, and Canada displayed a small spring peak (March-May), while the US, UK, and Canada showed a larger summer peak (July-September) (Figure 4e). The UK and Canada peaked first around July, followed by the US in August and Europe in September.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nBased on data from 86 studies, regular, cyclical patterns were observed for all enteric zoonotic diseases, with campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, VTEC, and cryptosporidiosis displaying distinct season-associated peaks. This review used easily interpretable measures of seasonality across diseases to compare monthly incidence patterns among major regions. Although global reviews of general seasonality in these diseases have typically focused on the climate-disease association and our results are not strictly comparable with these studies, they are largely consistent with literature published on individual diseases.\\n\\nThere are several potential mechanisms proposed to explain seasonal patterns in enteric diseases.

Increased temperatures could enhance pathogen survival and proliferation [9,50], potentially increase pathogen load in animal reservoirs [30] and prolong transmission seasons [51]. The consistent summer peak in bacterial diseases suggests the direct effect of a large-scale environmental influence on a shared exposure route.\\n\\nAs food is the dominant vehicle for transmission of these pathogens in many countries [52,53,54], it is probable that higher temperatures associated with summer increase the risk of food borne transmission [50]. For example, a study undertaken across six European countries reported a strong association between average monthly temperature and campylobacter incidence in both broiler chickens and humans [55]. Higher campylobacter prevalence in flocks and retail meat in summer have also been shown [56].\\n\\nSummer peaks in human VTEC infection have been associated with ground beef consumption [57] with similar findings for other bacterial pathogens [58,59]. For food borne illnesses, sustained warmer temperatures could increase length of transmission seasons, enhancing opportunities for food handling errors leading to outbreaks.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org | April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e31883\\n---\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh2 {\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #777;\\n}\\n\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\nSeasonal enteric disease outbreaks have been documented, with studies in New Zealand and the United Kingdom indicating that the association of bacterial enteric disease with climatic variables has weakened over time. This suggests that targeted health policies and obligatory industrial regulations were effective. The focused control of known transmission mechanisms may explain why the Gini indices for campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis were smaller than for VTEC, which is relatively less common and could have different dominant reservoirs and transmission pathways.\\n\\nEnvironmental influences can directly limit disease establishment and transmission or conversely, promote disease spread and severity. Evidence suggests that a proactive multidisciplinary approach to disease control and prevention could mitigate some of these impacts, particularly for predominantly foodborne pathogens.\\n\\nChanges in ambient physical conditions can influence environmentally mediated pathogen transmission pathways, playing an important role in driving seasonality in these diseases. For example, summer highs of campylobacteriosis in temperate countries have been hypothesized to occur due to summer increases in house fly density, with flies acting as mechanical vectors of transmission, thereby enhancing seasonal prevalence.\\n\\nSpring peaks in cryptosporidiosis incidence may be related to contamination of water supplies through heavy rainfall events. A study in North West England showed that in areas with marked seasonal patterns, cryptosporidiosis was associated with increased rainfall. In the same geographic region, a significant association between maximum river flows and cryptosporidiosis cases in spring was found, suggesting that increased seasonal pathogen load coupled with heavy rainfall could result in seasonally high disease rates. Unusually heavy runoff from spring snowmelt has also been implicated in protozoan disease outbreaks.\\n\\nSeasonal land use patterns that increase contact between animal reservoirs and human populations may be key determinants of regional and temporal differences in seasonality. For cryptosporidiosis, all represented regions had a prominent seasonal peak, commonly with a second smaller peak (bi-modal seasonal pattern), suggesting important regional variations in disease drivers. For example, both New Zealand and the UK displayed a prominent spring peak along with a smaller one in autumn for oceanic countries. Young livestock are a significant reservoir of enteric pathogens, and synchronization of agricultural practices such as calving takes place in both New Zealand and the UK in spring.\\n\\nComparable evidence exists for other enteric pathogens, highlighting the importance of land use patterns in driving strain-specific seasonal disease incidence. For example, the oceanic countries also showed spring peaks in campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis. In New Zealand, campylobacteriosis source attribution studies have found that ruminant strains pose a greater risk to rural children. Also, peak infection rates of a predominantly livestock strain of salmonella in humans are reported to track farming practices.\\n\\nThe comparatively high Gini index and narrow summer peak for VTEC indicate a seasonally restricted exposure, which could be related to seasonal agricultural activities. Agricultural variables such as cattle density, farm density, animal manure applied to soil, and farm visits have been recognized as important risk factors for VTEC infection. Moreover, livestock are a major reservoir, with seasonal patterns of pathogen shedding generally increasing in the warmer months. The high index could indicate seasonally high incidences due to difficulties associated with identifying, quantifying, and controlling environmental exposures.\\n\\n# Population Influences on Disease Incidence\\n\\nPeriodic oscillations in host characteristics are also an important seasonal forcing mechanism driving epidemiological patterns in enteric diseases. Seasonal, host-related factors could be cultural or socio-economic, linked to host lifestyle or cyclical immunity. For example, foreign travel plays an important role in explaining summer peaks in campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis in the UK and Europe, with regional differences in seasonality attributed to countries visited and dominant strains prevalent in these destinations.\\n\\nOur results for giardiasis indicated minimal inequality in incidence throughout the year as suggested by the Gini coefficient and seasonality index. Giardiasis incidence and spread is thought to be mainly a result of anthroponotic risk factors and transmission. The slightly elevated summer highs shown in the USA, UK, and Canada may imply increased person-to-person transmission in warmer months as a consequence of outdoor activities and exposure to untreated water sources.\\n\\nSimilarly, summer peaks in cryptosporidiosis incidence in the USA and Canada could be a consequence of host-related factors such as recreational water use and seasonal contact with livestock. As recent studies have found that social connectedness is an important predictor of diarrheal disease incidence, quantifying the relevance of specific population behaviors to seasonality in these diseases would be useful.\\n\\nAlthough few studies have documented interactions between environmental and population factors, these effects are not mutually exclusive. For example, a study assessing the relationship between climate variables, Salmonella incidence in retail chicken, and human cases in Canada found a positive association with temperature, but it was summer barbequing and gardening that were identified as primary risk factors. In New Zealand, population drinking water quality was found to modify the positive association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis, with better quality drinking water having a protective effect.\\n\\nEnvironmental effects are expected to have a considerable impact on existing patterns in human geography in the future, in some instances modifying environment-pathogen-host interactions substantially. As temperate, developed countries are expected to experience increasing climate variability, land use intensification, and urbanization, efforts to reconcile human health with these changes are crucial.\\n\\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org | April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e31883\\n---\\n# Seasonality in Human Enteric Diseases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .author-contributions {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}'),\n",

Targeted ecological studies combined with microbiological analysis and population intensive monitoring would be useful in elucidating the relative importance of specific enteric pathogens (and strains), their transmission, spread and seasonal significance on enteric disease burden.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nSeasonality in enteric diseases with predominantly animal reservoirs is ubiquitous. The diseases reviewed show consistent seasonal patterns across trans-national boundaries, albeit with regional variations in these patterns. Understanding disease specific seasonal patterns is important for improving existing disease surveillance methods, generating appropriate prevention strategies, developing valid prediction models, and enhancing cross-border cooperation. Although an individual level focus is often necessary to infer causality, assessing population level patterns allows environmental processes, which typically function at international scales, to be integrated into the public health framework. This perspective is particularly important for those diseases where trans-boundary environmental change plays a pivotal role in disease incidence, which may not be measurable at the individual scale.\\n\\nRegional variations in seasonal patterns provide an insight into the complex hierarchical and nonlinear nature of interactions between environmental, pathogen and host specific factors and transmission opportunities. These finer scale patterns also highlight regions that follow the expected pattern and those that are outliers, which is crucial information to establish region specific determinants of disease variability. Results from this review encourage targeted ecological, microbiological and population focused investigations to uncover causal mechanisms driving seasonality, particularly at the regional level. This need is particularly important as this review indicates that local landscape changes and population dynamics, together with longer-term climate change, could have far-reaching direct and indirect consequences for future enteric disease risk.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\nTable S1: Attributes of 86 studies across five enteric diseases selected for review.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank Associate Professor Gerry Closs for his comments on the manuscript.\\n\\n# Author Contributions\\n\\nConceived and designed the experiments: AL SH NF MB.

Yet, the combined effect of local socioeconomic and demographic factors and weather variation on child health is poorly understood. With a focus on childhood diarrhoea caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium spp., an infection easily controlled by public health interventions but also strongly linked to environmental conditions through waterborne spread, we systematically review and empirically model the effects of local weather and flooding history, after controlling for seasonality, publication bias, access to improved sanitation, health resources and population density at a global scale.\\n\\nWe examined 1588 papers on childhood cryptosporidiosis and identified 36 studies representing a range of geographic locations and climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions. Local rainfall and population density were related with cryptosporidiosis across latitudes as shown by mixed effects, spatio-temporal models for equatorial, sub-tropical and temperate climates. In equatorial (0–20°) latitudes, the previous month's rainfall and population density were inversely related with childhood cryptosporidiosis with a significant random effect for flooding history. In tropical-subtropical (20–35°) latitudes, rainfall in December was inversely related with cryptosporidiosis, compared to rainfall in April (the wet season). In temperate latitudes (N35°), there was a significant negative association of reported disease with population density.\\n\\nThis global empirical analysis indicates differential spatio-temporal patterns of childhood cryptosporidiosis in low, mid and high latitude regions. Models that couple weather conditions with demographic factors are needed to assess disease distributional shifts and risks due to environmental change. These results may provide impetus to develop environment-focused public health policies to manage disease risks associated with climate change for future generations.\\n\\n© 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.\\n\\nCorresponding author: aparna.lal@anu.edu.au\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.02.365\\n\\nISSN: 0048-9697\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Environmental and Social Factors on Diarrhoeal Disease Risk in Children\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# A.

Introduction\\n\\nThe frequency of floods and population growth are expected to increase in many low-latitude countries (Hirabayashi et al., 2013). Here, waterborne diarrhoea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children (Walker et al., 2013; Lopez et al., 2006). Substantial gains in public health and infectious disease control in the past century have resulted in diarrhoeal mortality declining at 4% per year (Liu et al., 2012), with an estimated 74% of diarrhoea related deaths in children younger than five years clustered in a limited number of countries (Walker et al., 2013). In contrast, trajectories of diarrhoeal disease incidence are decreasing more slowly (Walker et al., 2012) and regional patterns are not as distinct (Walker et al., 2013). Global insights into region-specific environmental and social risk factors may inform targeted interventions to further accelerate the reduction in diarrhoeal incidence in the context of projected environmental change.\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis is a major cause of parasitic diarrhoea in children. In the three year prospective Global Enteric Multicenter Study of childhood diarrhoea, the parasite Cryptosporidium was the second leading cause (5–15%) of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in infants and associated with an increased risk of mortality in toddlers aged 12–23 months at all seven study sites in Africa and South Asia (Kotloff et al., 2013). It is spread via the faecal-oral route including person-to-person, animal-to-person, waterborne and foodborne transmission (Fayer et al., 2000). Cryptosporidium is environmentally persistent with a low infectious dose (Fayer et al., 2000; Chappell et al., 2006). Disease incidence patterns show a distinct seasonality (Lal et al., 2012) and strong associations with weather globally (Jagai et al., 2009).\\n\\nMost studies addressing the synergistic effects of environmental and social factors on cryptosporidiosis diarrhoea have been conducted in single small-scale sites. Conversely, global studies of cryptosporidiosis have focused on the relationship with climatic or social factors, with little empirical analyses of these determinants together. To our knowledge, there has been no global spatio-temporal analysis of the environmental and social factors that are associated with childhood cryptosporidiosis, despite recent evidence suggesting the burden in children is 2.5 times higher than previously estimated (Khalil et al., 2018).\\n\\nThe health impacts of extreme weather events are highly dependent on socio-economic development and availability of infrastructure such as access to sanitation and potable water (Fuller et al., 2015), as seen in Ecuador (Carlton et al., 2013), New Zealand (Britton et al., 2010) and Bangladesh (Hashizume et al., 2008), to name a few. Considerable variation in the magnitude of health responses to extreme weather events make it clear that a single-factor perspective for studying and managing waterborne disease risk is inadequate (Mellor et al., 2016). The lack of global analyses is an important gap in our understanding of how the spread of cryptosporidiosis in children may respond to future environmental and social change.\\n\\nThrough a systematic review of the published literature, we assess the available evidence regarding the effects of environmental and social conditions on diarrhoeal disease risk in children, demonstrated with cryptosporidiosis. We use the disease data from this review to develop mixed, spatio-temporal models that examine the effects of local weather and flooding history on disease risk, after controlling for publication bias, access to improved drinking water and sanitation, health resources and population density.\\n\\n# 2. Methods\\n\\n# 2.1. Systematic review of the literature\\n\\nWe systematically searched three electronic databases, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase to identify articles published from 1960 to 2014 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Fig. 1). The search strategy used the keywords “children” AND (“cryptosporidiosis” OR “cryptosporidium”). This initial review was completed by two authors independently (AL and EF), then, articles selected for inclusion based on title and abstract were sourced in full and reviewed again using the criteria described below. We excluded studies that had not been conducted continuously for a minimum of a full year to cover all seasons. Only studies where the primary outcome was a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of Cryptosporidium were included, as seasonal patterns for gastroenteritis can be pathogen specific. We also excluded studies where data was not reported temporally (monthly at a minimum), and by age group. No language or database restrictions were imposed on the searches. The reference lists of the full-text versions of the articles that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were manually searched to identify any further relevant manuscripts. Bibliographies of reviews published on Cryptosporidium epidemiology were also examined to identify additional sources for inclusion in the analysis.\\n\\nStudies that satisfied the inclusion conditions but failed to be representative of the general population were excluded. These comprised studies that were (i) conducted in institutions (e.g. day-care centers), (ii) directed at specific ethnic groups and groups with certain characteristics (e.g. immune-compromised patients, travelers, refugees), (iii) studies focused solely on outbreaks as these studies can reflect disease patterns that may not be typical of disease patterns generally or clinically focused studies (e.g. drug efficacy studies or case reports). Animal and intervention studies were excluded. Fig. 1 demonstrates how the studies were classified and reasons for exclusion.\"),\n",

Animal and intervention studies were excluded. Fig. 1 demonstrates how the studies were classified and reasons for exclusion.\\n\\nData extraction from each eligible article was done independently by two investigators (EF and EW) and, in the case of discrepancies; the final decision was that of a third investigator (AL). From each eligible article, we recorded the authors and year of publication, location and study duration, study design, sample size and age range of study population. Table S2 in the electronic supplementary material provides details for the selected studies. Using the study sites' latitude and longitude each study site was plotted on a map using ESRI's ArcMap 10.3.1 software. Fig. 2 provides a map of study locations and the number of studies in each location. To map studies conducted across multiple cities, the capital city was used to visualize study location. To visualize the average incidence of cryptosporidiosis in children by hydrological subregions defined by the World Meteorological Organization (Fig. 1), each study was linked to the WMO subregion based on GIS layers provided by the Global Runoff Data Centre (2004). The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.\\n\\nMonthly data for each of the study months was extracted from the papers, either directly from the tables or extracted from graphs using DigitizeIt software (Bormann, 2012). From all eligible published studies, we extracted monthly data of laboratory confirmed cryptosporidiosis among children aged 0–15 years worldwide. Using each study site's longitude and latitude, we supplemented monthly illness data with time period specific precipitation, obtained from the KNMI Climate Explorer (http://climexp.knmi.nl/). Each study site was classified based on the Human Development Index (HDI) which was used as a summary measure of a country's development status, as published by the Human Development Report Office at the United Nations Development Programme (Jahan et al., 2015), and the country's population density, as published the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2015). The HDI is a composite measure of the ability to acquire knowledge (measured by length of schooling), life expectancy at birth and gross national income per capita, to reflect more than just the economic status of a country (Jahan et al., 2015). The year of study was used to assign the HDI and population density. Based on the region and year, each study was assigned a value for total sanitation coverage as a percent of the total population. This data was extracted from the World Health Organization and United Nations International Children's.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Flood Risk and Sanitation Infrastructure\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n.flowchart {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n\\n# Flood Risk Assessment and Sanitation Infrastructure\\n\\n# Authors: A.

Assessment of Publication Bias\\n\\nUsing previously published methods, the reporting efforts for each region were calculated by estimating the frequency of infectious disease articles published each year from 1960 to 2014 (Yang et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2008). In PubMed, “infectious disease” and “region name” were used as keywords in the search of publications to generate an estimate of the reporting effort for each region. Reporting effort by geographic region was calculated as the total number of studies in each region divided by the total number of studies on infectious disease published over the entire time-period and multiplied by 100. To control for this spatial heterogeneity in reporting effort, the number of publications in each region (logged to the base 10) was used as a covariate in the spatio-temporal analysis (Yang et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2008).\\n\\n# 2.3. Statistical Analysis\\n\\nWe applied mixed effects spatio-temporal models to investigate the relationship between cryptosporidiosis incidence and the climatic variable (monthly average precipitation), while accounting for publication bias, population density, economic development (HDI), sanitation coverage, and flooding history.\\n\\nData were delimited by latitude. Studies conducted between 0° and 20° on either side of the equator were categorized as “equatorial” (West Africa, Nigeria, the Gambia, Zambia, Brazil, Kenya, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Haiti), those between 20° and 35° were “tropical-subtropical” (West Mexico, Cuba, India, Bangladesh, Kuwait, South Africa, Tunisia, Western Australia) and those above 35° were “temperate” (United States, Ireland, England, West Scotland). To standardize the different outcome measures used in each study and the climatic variables, the raw values were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 prior to running the statistical analyses. Prior to analysis, collinearity among the variables was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Standardized cryptosporidiosis was not significantly associated with any of the covariates of interest (r < 0.5, P > 0.05) for any of the included studies. Significant correlations between the Human Development Index (HDI), latitude, and population density were found although these correlations were all below r = 0.5. Population density and the number of publications for the region were log-transformed to the base 10 to aid in interpretation of model coefficients and normalize residuals (Dunn et al., 2010).\\n\\nAs the shape of the relationship between cryptosporidiosis and rainfall can vary in different climate zones, we examined the shape and included quadratic terms for monthly rainfall in the models for the tropical-subtropical (20°–35°) zone. Multiple comparisons using different lags for rainfall were run. As we were also interested in the interaction between rainfall and month, the term “rainfall*month” was included in every model. All models were run using the “lme” package in the software R (R Development Core Team, 2012). Models were ranked using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and models with the lowest AIC were chosen. The full models for each zone are provided in Table 1. To assess fit of the selected model, we saved model residuals and examined them against fitted values to assess model performance, through a Q-Q plot to detect obvious departures from model assumptions and a histogram of residuals to check for normality.\\n\\n# 3.

Summary of Effects of Flooding History, Population Density, Sanitation Infrastructure and Development on Waterborne Disease Risk\\n\\nOf the 1588 unique citations retrieved from the literature search, 36 studies were included from the 1009 full-text articles reviewed (Fig. 1). Study specific characteristics are shown in Table S2. Combined, the systematic search resulted in a total of 34 unique data sources in 22 countries, including southern and northern hemisphere temperate climates as well as tropical and arid regions of Asia, Oceania, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Studies were published as early as 1982, with 42% (15/36) conducted in the 1980s, 30.5% (11/36) in the 1990s, and 27.7% (10/36) in the 2000s. A large proportion of the published work is based on observational studies and analyses of data from retrospective surveillance systems (35 studies, 94.6%), fewer studies involve active recruitment and following of children (two studies, 5.4%). Of the 36 included studies, 11 were from Africa, seven from the United States, five from the Caribbean region, two from Kuwait, and one each from Australia, Bangladesh, and Brazil.\\n\\nThe studies we reviewed used different measures of cryptosporidiosis. Of the 36 studies, 23 studies (63.8%) present outcome data as number of cases, seven studies (19.4%) present outcome as percent positive stools, and six studies (16.6%) present outcome as prevalence.\\n\\nFig. 2 is an illustration of the standardized cryptosporidiosis risk as a function of the HDI for each flood risk category for each study. The sizes of the circles represent the population density with the colors showing the level of sanitation infrastructure (low < 30%, high 40–80% and very high > 80%). Areas classed as having very high flood risk (> 5000 deaths due to floods in the five years preceding the study start date) are also areas with the highest population density and lowest availability of sanitation infrastructure and tend to be the least developed (extreme left of Fig. 2). All studies with very high sanitation infrastructure are based in areas with low flood risk (< 500 deaths due to floods in the five years preceding the study start date) (extreme right of Fig. 2). This panel also has the highest number of studies, most of which have been conducted in high HDI areas. Areas with high (500–1000) and moderate (1000–5000) deaths due to floods in the five years preceding the study start date tend to be less developed with low to high availability of sanitation infrastructure.\\n\\n# 3.2. Assessment of Study Quality\\n\\nBias assessment of included studies is as outlined in Table S1. There was moderate risk of selection bias in the majority of studies as many were convenience samples from diagnostic laboratories or selected health facilities; four were classified as low risk of bias with more representative population sampling outlined in study methods. Performance and detection bias was similarly moderate, where identification and assessment of potential confounders was limited and results often limited to descriptive frequency reporting only. Information bias was almost uniformly low, as laboratory methods to confirm the study outcome of cryptosporidiosis were clearly provided in all included studies, with the exception of two studies. The studies with moderate information bias risk included one that did not specify which laboratory method was used to identify Cryptosporidium oocysts (Baxby and Hart, 1986) and one study that was a case control study that did have an objective laboratory assessment of the cryptosporidiosis for cases, but not for the controls (Roy et al., 2004).\\n\\n# 3.3. Assessment of Publication Bias\\n\\nFig. S1 shows a strong, temporal trend in the number of publications on infectious diseases from 1960 to 2014, which was closely correlated to the published incidence of cryptosporidiosis over time (Pearson correlation: 0.91). A similar temporal pattern was observed for all regions.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Statistical Analysis of Cryptosporidiosis Risk\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.bold {\\nfont-weight: bold;\\n}\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis of Cryptosporidiosis Risk\\n\\n# Table 1: Coefficients for Chosen Regression Model\\n\\nCoefficients for chosen regression model for the Equatorial region, tropical-subtropical and temperate regions.

Discussion\\n\\nClear geographic patterns at a global scale are evident in the published incidence of waterborne disease, illustrated with cryptosporidiosis, the leading cause of parasitic diarrhoea among children. Globally, rainfall and population density were associated with childhood cryptosporidiosis. These results are broadly consistent with the known latitudinal gradient in human infectious disease distribution (Jones et al., 2013). Generally, the strength of the association with rainfall decreased at higher latitudes. The human development index was not associated with the reported incidence of cryptosporidiosis (Tables S2–S4), suggesting that local weather and demography may be more important than country-specific development for childhood cryptosporidiosis. Flooding history was important in the equatorial region, as shown by the lower residual variance, providing a fundamental context to advocate for integrated flood risk and health outcome planning in regions that expect increased flooding.\\n\\nThe strengths of our analysis include a structured approach to selecting articles and integrating data from multiple fields, including meteorology, hydrology, and observational epidemiology. Based on our results, we now have a comprehensive overview of what is known about flooding history and waterborne transmission of cryptosporidiosis diarrhoea among children. Some of the generalizations from this study include the limited number of papers on cryptosporidiosis until the early 1990s; we have now systematically and quantitatively assessed the trajectory of this literature. A broad geographic range is represented in the disease incidence data, but there is a concentration of effort areas such as Africa. We acknowledge that this bias in the larger picture may be partly due to our search strategy. We limited our review to articles published in English or foreign language articles with abstracts in English, which may have decreased our ability to collect the broadest sample of reports on these exposures. However, only 39 of the 1588 articles captured in our initial search (which was not restricted by language) were rejected based on language. Many of these reports were considered irrelevant because review of the titles and abstracts determined that they did not explore the relationship between cryptosporidiosis in children at the temporal scale needed.\\n\\nConfounding presents a substantial challenge for assessments of the impacts of climate change on infectious disease (Ebi et al., 2013). Our study shows that populations at lower latitudes are much more likely to have high population densities and lower socio-economic development and therefore higher disease risk due to pathways other than environmental transmission, such as hygiene, water, and sanitation infrastructure. Although we compiled data from a relatively large number of studies, our sample sizes were limited for combinations of drivers. The fact that for High HDI areas such as North America, there was a positive correlation between increasing population density and HDI with an inverse pattern seen in low and medium HDI areas suggests that differentiating the context-dependent effects of HDI, latitude, and population density may be possible as more high-resolution data on specific drivers become available. Our analyses indicate that data on human population density and socio-economic development act as reasonable proxies for some of the anthropogenic changes that influence infectious disease incidence.\\n\\nA related problem is the limited availability of pathogen-specific data. Deficiencies in the current availability and quality of infectious disease data prevent comprehensive mapping for all but a few diseases (Hay et al., 2006, 2013). The generally moderate quality of the included studies (Table S1) limits detailed investigation. The Global Burden of Disease collaboration represents a significant step forward in the effort to provide comparable and considerable spatial and temporal coverage of human disease data. Our results support previous studies showing that climatic factors are important drivers of diarrhoea. The inclusion of flooding history in the current study is novel. With an understanding of how historical weather extremes are related to child health, we may be able to better integrate climate change into flood management and human health prioritization decisions.\\n\\nRecent global reviews have shown a positive association of temperature and rainfall with all-cause diarrhoea (Carlton et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2016) and suggested a mechanistic systems-based approach that involves environmental and engineered infrastructure to reduce the risk of diarrhoea in the context of climate change (Mellor et al., 2016). The need for greater integration between social and natural sciences to understand the region-specific impacts of climate change on population health has also been emphasized (McMichael et al., 2015). In rural Nigeria, heavy rainfall has an important impact on child health, irrespective of the measure of child welfare used, with a significant and positive impact on the incidence of diarrhoea (Rabassa et al., 2014). In India, children exposed to drought around birth and in the first trimester of pregnancy (embryonic stage) were more likely to be underweight compared to children born in the first and second quarters after a drought (Kumar et al., 2016). Despite this literature, there has been little multi-country investigation into how these factors shape childhood health. We agree with the Late Emeritus Professor Tony McMichael who observed that “Children warrant special concern, both as children per se and as the coming generation likely to face ever more extreme climate conditions later this century” (McMichael, 2014). There is also increasing evidence of the potential risks to water and sanitation services posed by climate change and the need to integrate measures of climate resilience into water safety plans (Howard et al., 2016). Our finding that local rainfall is a determinant of cryptosporidiosis in children globally, after accounting for publication bias and sanitation infrastructure, provides a strong argument for an integrated and child-centered water protection policy, in the context of an increasingly variable climate.\\n\\nFlooding can increase microbiological pollution of surface waters, with contamination due to Cryptosporidium spp. being 2.61 times higher during and after heavy rain (Young et al., 2015). To our knowledge, including flooding history as well as current rainfall as a determinant of childhood cryptosporidiosis at the global scale is novel. Our finding that historical flooding is an important determinant of reported disease in the equatorial region where the burden of cryptosporidiosis is currently the highest provides a timely opportunity for researchers to engage with environmental managers and industry to prevent microbiological water pollution.\\n\\n# 5. Conclusions\\n\\nUnderstanding the role of key environmental influences on childhood infections is an important aspect of both disease response and public health prevention strategies. Our findings add to the mounting evidence that environmental changes that include local weather and climate extremes in addition to increasing population density will create scientific challenges and community concerns for disease management.\\n\\n# Competing Interests\\n\\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments'),\n",

Changes in the underlying population have contributed to this, including the impacts of population increases after World War I, World War II and the ‘baby boom’ of the 1960s. A recent increase in risk or ascertainment within this population has caused an increase in cases in all age groups from 2004 to 2011. The seasonal increase in cases between weeks 18 (Early May) and 22 (Early June) was consistent across ages, years and regions and was most marked in children and in more rural regions. Campylobacter prevalence by week in each region correlated with temperature 2 weeks before. There were higher prevalences in areas with a low population density, low deprivation and lower percentage of people of ethnic origin.

Chicken has been implicated as the source of infection in up to 80% of infections and as the risk factor associated with transmission in 41%. Actions to reduce the contamination of chickens in New Zealand have shown dramatic reductions in human cases. Despite this, the epidemiology of Campylobacter remains complicated and some features seem difficult to explain.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Clinical Presentation\\n\\nRoutine surveillance of 994,791 Campylobacter patients between 1989 and 2009 showed that they were predominantly from gastrointestinal sites (99.65%) and were associated with diarrhoea. There were 82 Campylobacter-related deaths (0.008%). Overall, 242 (0.25%) of isolates were from infections involving a sterile body site, including blood (1665), brain or cerebrospinal fluid (67), wounds (45), cardiac prostheses (15), peritoneum (6), and joints (3).\\n\\nA majority of Campylobacter fetus cases (61 of 72; 85%) were invasive, and 75% of C. fetus patients were older than 50 years compared with 44% of all Campylobacter isolates. Invasive infections were below 0.13% of all infections in people younger than 60 years but represented 0.37% of those between 60 and 79 years and 0.78% of infections in people older than 80 years.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nCampylobacter surveillance data reported from diagnostic laboratories in England and Wales from 1989 to 2011 were extracted from the Oracle (LabBase) database and analysed. Most analyses were for the period 1989 to 2009, but annual cases were extended to 2011 (2011 data provisional). All were laboratory-confirmed cases, most were symptomatic, and included patients with extraintestinal infections.\\n\\nStandard antimicrobial testing methods, used in primary diagnostic laboratories, were predominantly disc diffusion methods. Cases were linked by postcode to lower-level super output area and medium-level super output area (MSOA), deprivation index, ethnic origin, population density, and census data using data held on the Office for National Statistics website.\\n\\n# Long-term Changes\\n\\nThere were 1,109,406 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to national surveillance between 1989 and 2011. Cases in 2011 were 45% above 2004 figures and 3% above 2010 figures. The cases rose from 33,280 in 1989 to a peak of 58,235 in 2000 before dropping to 44,544 in 2004 and rising to a maximum of 64,582 in 2011 (2011 data provisional).\\n\\nThere was a marked long-term increase in the percentage of cases in people older than 50 years, with a decline in the incidence in babies and children younger than 10 years from 2000 and a subsequent increase from 2006 to 2010.\\n\\nSource: Nichols GL, Richardson JF, Sheppard SK, et al.

This was mirrored by the age-specific prevalence, which showed a 30% higher prevalence in men compared with women across most age groups. The age distribution varied geographically, with London having more infections in young adults and less in people older than 40 years. The age distribution of travel-related cases showed lower rates in children and people over 60 years and more cases in people between 20 and 35 years.\\n\\nThe age distribution of cases between 1989 and 2010 differed significantly between Salmonella and Campylobacter, with a higher proportion of Salmonella cases in children and a higher proportion of Campylobacter cases in adults. The age structure of cases has shifted over 20 years with more infection in older people in recent years. For example, comparison of Campylobacter data from 2008 with 2008 population estimates shows the impact of the age structure of the population on the prevalence in 2008. The steady increase in the percentage of people older than 50 years partly reflects ageing of the underlying population. When examined as an age-specific prevalence, there has been a recent increase in infections in older people, particularly in men. There was also an increase in 20-32 year-olds of both sexes around 2000 that was linked to the general increase in cases at this time. There was also a decline in the prevalence in children younger than 4 years from 2000 onwards. The seasonality of Campylobacter was much more marked in young children than in other ages.\\n\\n# Typing\\n\\nCampylobacter isolates from human cases between 1989 and 2009 could be differentiated into 64 serotypes, 86 phage types, and 949 combined HS/PT types. Isolates of Campylobacter jejuni contained 57 serotypes, 80 phage types, and 866 HS/PT types, with two thirds of serotypes of C. jejuni represented in seven serotypes. Campylobacter coli contained 25 serotypes, 30 phage types, and 102 HS/PT types, with five serotypes making up 84% of isolates. When the combined ST/PT of typable isolates were examined, no type exceeded 9% of the total typed C. jejuni and 18% of typed C. coli strains. Among the combined HS/PT types, most isolates had few representatives, although the distribution differed when HS and PT were examined separately.\\n\\nFor the MLST data, all human cases reported on the PubMLST database were grouped by the seven sequenced genes. Up to September 2011, there were 33 CCs and 757 STs among isolates from people with Campylobacter submitted to the PubMLST website. 94.8% of C. coli were of one type (ST-828 complex) and 34.2% of C. jejuni of two types (ST-21 complex and ST-257 complex). While most isolates clustered into one of the predominant CCs, the STs showed a distribution with a few common types and many types with low numbers of isolates. This may partly reflect the submission patterns for the PubMLST database, with ‘rare’ STs over-represented as a proportion of all isolates, although a similar distribution was found for the combined HS and PT types where this was not an issue. The distribution of individual serotypes and phage types mirrored that of the CCs.\\n\\n# Antimicrobial Resistance\\n\\nOver the period from 1989 to 2009, there was an increase in the percentage of Campylobacter isolates that were fully or intermediately resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and erythromycin. The percentage of strains that were resistant to ciprofloxacin was higher in people who had recently travelled abroad compared with those who had not, and where travel status was not recorded. Isolates with high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin were found in people who had travelled to India, Egypt, Spain, and Thailand.\\n\\n# Weekends, Bank Holidays, and Other Holidays\\n\\nThe onset date was not reported for most Campylobacter infections; the specimen date was recorded in surveillance. Specimens with any single weekday ranged from 16.8% to 22.3% of all cases, whereas cases were less common on Saturday.\\n\\nPublished by BMJ Open, 2012; doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001179\\n---\\n# Review of a Million Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.data-table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.data-table th, .data-table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\n}\\n.data-table th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\n\\n# Review of a Million Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nThis paper reviews the epidemiology of Campylobacter infections, focusing on the seasonal trends and age distribution of cases.\\n\\n# Age Distribution of Cases\\n\\nAge Group\\nPercentage of Cases\\n\\n0-9 months\\n3.2%\\n\\n10-18 months\\n1.5%\\n\\n1.5-3 years\\n3%\\n\\n3-6 years\\n5%\\n\\n7-12 years\\n8%\\n\\n13-24 years\\n2%\\n\\n25-48 years\\n2%\\n\\n>48 years\\n2%\\n\\n# Seasonality of Cases\\n\\nCases were normalized to account for the day of the week, bank holidays, and long-term trends. This analysis revealed a regular seasonal increase in late spring, resembling an annual epidemic pattern. The increase in cases typically occurs between weeks 18 (Early May) and 22 (Early June), particularly pronounced in young children.\\n\\n# Postcode Prevalence\\n\\nThe patient postcode is essential for determining local prevalence and creating maps of Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs).

This analysis revealed a regular seasonal increase in late spring, resembling an annual epidemic pattern. The increase in cases typically occurs between weeks 18 (Early May) and 22 (Early June), particularly pronounced in young children.\\n\\n# Postcode Prevalence\\n\\nThe patient postcode is essential for determining local prevalence and creating maps of Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs). In 2009, only 76% of patient records had an associated postcode, leading to an underestimation of prevalence in some areas. The overall prevalence in England and Wales for 2009 was 105 per 100,000 per year, with significant variations across different regions.\\n\\nFigure 4B: Seasonal trends in Campylobacter cases.\\n\\nIn conclusion, understanding the age distribution and seasonal patterns of Campylobacter infections is crucial for public health interventions and resource allocation.\\n\\nSource: Nichols GL, Richardson JF, Sheppard SK, et al.

Cases of Campylobacter per 100,000 population were higher in areas of low population density (rural) compared with areas of high population density (urban settings). Less postcode reporting in areas of high population density or deprivation could introduce some bias; however, subset analysis of areas with over 90% postcode reporting still showed higher prevalence in areas of lower population density. The reason for the urban/rural difference remains unclear but could reflect proximity to ruminants and other farmed animals or differences in access to healthcare.\\n\\nThere was an inverse relationship between Campylobacter prevalence and the Oxford Index of Multiple Deprivation. People with Campylobacter from deprived areas were less frequently reported to surveillance than in less deprived areas. The reason could reflect different diets, prior exposure conferring some resistance, or reduced access to healthcare. The prevalence of Campylobacter in communities where more than 95% of the population was ‘white British’ was greater than those where the percentage was <50%, possibly due to poorer access to healthcare, greater susceptibility, or increased exposure.\\n\\n# Overseas Travel\\n\\nOverseas travel to both EU and non-EU countries was associated with almost a fifth of all Campylobacter infections in data from enhanced surveillance. Spain, the country most visited, remains the country with the largest source of travel-related cases. Routine surveillance of travel-related cases shows poor and inconsistent ascertainment. Less is known about the risk factors responsible for travel-related Campylobacter than from indigenous infections and the risks may vary between countries visited.\\n\\n# Chicken Production\\n\\nThe long-term change in Campylobacter cases in England and Wales was compared with poultry produced in the UK after removing exports and including imports. Chicken production was used as a surrogate for chicken consumption and showed that over the 23-year period the relationship was not linear, implying that Campylobacter prevalence is not directly related to the amount of chicken consumed.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe reasons for large long-term changes in Campylobacter cases, the spring increase, the increase in older people, the higher cases in rural communities, and more cases in less deprived people could be related to features of diagnosis and reporting (commonly referred to as ascertainment) or of disease within the population as a result of increased exposure or susceptibility (here referred to as risk). The increase in cases in all three age groups between 2004 and 2009 can be compared with the period 1994 to 2000 where there was a decrease in cases in babies and children younger than 10 years, the increase in cases in people aged 10-49 years, and the large increase in people older than 50. This suggests that the drivers are complex and may include changes in attribution and risk.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that some of the cases in children may be less likely to attend a physician and have a specimen taken as a result of the triaging associated with NHS Direct, although the people responding to NHS Direct are a small proportion of those with diarrhoea.\\n\\nIn order to examine the impacts of various factors on the long-term change, seasonal increase, increase in people more than 50 years old, the urban/rural split, and the socioeconomic factors, a table was drawn up. The increase in Campylobacter in patients older than 50 years between 2004 and 2010 is dramatic and may be linked to proton pump inhibitor use. These drugs may increase people’s susceptibility to Campylobacter, and the older population group are more likely to be taking these drugs than the younger ones.'),\n",

These drugs may increase people’s susceptibility to Campylobacter, and the older population group are more likely to be taking these drugs than the younger ones.\\n\\nThe underlying demographic drive, where the increased birth rate after World War I and World War II and the 1960s baby boom is represented by diagonal lines, shows the impact of population size on Campylobacter cases over the years. This demographic drive is likely to contribute to the age distribution of cases, as the number of older people in the population is increasing but may also influence year-on-year changes.\\n\\nThe economic downturn, which began in 2008, may have changed people’s eating habits and exposed people to foods that are more commonly contaminated with Campylobacter. Alternatively, the chicken products within retail shops may have become more contaminated or there could be increased consumption of more contaminated products like chicken liver. There may also be effects resulting from a reduction in GP consultations for infectious intestinal disease. The increase in cases since 2004 seems to be across all ages.

There could have been systematic change in recent years in the efficiency of isolation, either through reduced specimen delay or improved culture media or culture conditions (e.g., atmosphere). In a longitudinal study of infectious intestinal disease, detection of Campylobacter was better with culture and/or PCR than with culture alone. In addition, there was better isolation by culture alone in community cases than in those presenting to GPs when compared with culture and PCR, possibly reflecting greater delay in GP samples being sent for culture compared with community cases.\\n\\n# Seasonality\\n\\nThe late spring increase in cases, particularly in children where the increase over a few weeks can be fourfold in some regions, has remained an enigma for many years and implies a seasonal driver that is probably indirect and related to environmental and climatic conditions. The seasonality differs by region, by year, and by latitude and longitude, suggesting that weather combined with the farming environment is important. Possible drivers and transmission by flies include increased contamination of chicken.\\n\\nPublished evidence indicates that children in rural areas are more likely to be infected with ruminant strains, presumably from direct or indirect contamination from the environment. Data on seasonal distribution and from typing data make it unlikely that a single common source is the driver and imply contamination from multiple sources. There remains a need to tease out the contributions from possible drivers. There is a similar seasonality in Campylobacter contamination of chicken flocks where environmental drivers may be important.\\n\\nWhile the seasonality variables of human infections correlate with the rise in human cases, it can precede climatic and chicken contamination, consistent with a common factor causing the increase in both. It has been suggested that flies might be the route by which Campylobacter enter chicken flocks, and some modelling of chicken data supports this hypothesis. In addition, transmission of Campylobacter to humans by flies has been hypothesised as a way of explaining the characteristic seasonality of human Campylobacter infections, although testing this may prove difficult. The seasonal distribution of Campylobacter in different countries may be related to their differing weather patterns.\\n\\n# Typing\\n\\nThe typing of Campylobacter isolates has proved useful in outbreak investigation using HS/PT typing and MLST typing and also in attributing strains to particular host sources using MLST typing. The distribution of different HS/PT types, with a few common types and a long tail of rare ones, is similar to that previously reported for Campylobacter using MLST typing, but the ability to group into clonal complexes makes MLST a more practical scheme for attribution. These data provide some indication of the potential diversity of phenotypes that reflect the labile genetic structure of this organism.\\n\\nData on the individual seven MLST alleles and on the HS/PT typing provide a way of looking at the genetic diversity of Campylobacter isolates from human infections. The frequency of different types from PubMLST may be influenced by inconsistencies in data submission and by bias towards rarer types so more unusual types appear than they would in a natural population. For the Sentinel Surveillance data, the isolates were collected in a more systematic way and are therefore more representative. The observed distribution for individual MLST alleles, for ST types and for combined HS/PT types might suggest that the most common types are perhaps those most easily able to propagate themselves within human or animal hosts. However, there is little evidence supporting this conjecture.\\n\\n# Antibiotics\\n\\nThe increasing resistance of isolates to antibiotics is partly due to an increase in quinolone resistance in Campylobacter.\\n\\n10 Nichols GL, Richardson JF, Sheppard SK, et al.

This suggests that the degree of contamination may be more important than the total poultry weight produced. Most human infections are related to people returning from travel abroad and partly increased resistance to other antibiotics in isolates from all areas. The rise in resistance to erythromycin has been less dramatic and does not show an association with foreign travel. It is therefore probably related to domestic human use of this drug.\\n\\nSource: Nichols GL, Richardson JF, Sheppard SK, et al.

Attribution studies indicate that strains commonly found in chickens are prevalent in human infections, suggesting that the source of Campylobacter is primarily chicken. Epidemiological studies highlight that contact with or consumption of chicken is a significant transmission route for infection.\\n\\n# Disease Burden\\n\\nThe disease burden from Campylobacter is estimated at 500,000 cases per year, with 80,000 GP consultations conducted over 16 months. However, there may be substantial underascertainment in areas with greater deprivation and/or larger ethnic populations. The reasons for higher cases in men compared to women, and the prevalence in rural versus urban environments, remain unclear.\\n\\n# Implications\\n\\nResearch should focus on interventions, necessitating a better understanding of epidemiology. Typing data has been beneficial for source attribution and may aid in measuring the impact of interventions aimed at reducing chicken contamination. Utilizing an archive of strains typed by serotype and phage type could provide insights into long-term changes by linking phenotypic and MLST typing.\\n\\nThere is a need for whole genome MLST typing on a percentage of strains obtained through surveillance over an extended period. Understanding the drivers for change beyond source, such as transmission routes and climate impacts, is essential. The underlying population significantly contributes to disease epidemiology, warranting further examination.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors acknowledge the extensive contributions of clinical, laboratory, scientific, and Environmental Health staff responsible for diagnosing and reporting cases throughout the review period.

The cost of enteric infections in Australia is estimated to exceed $1.2 billion each year. The Australian national food-borne diseases surveillance system recorded 24,313 notifications of eight potentially food-borne diseases in 2004, with Campylobacter infections being the most common.\\n\\n# Meteorological Data\\n\\nThe weather stations utilized in this study include the Kent Town station in Adelaide and Brisbane Airport station. Both stations have a long history of weather records, which accurately represent local weather variability. Daily, weekly, and monthly weather variables, including mean maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity, and rainfall, were analyzed over the study period.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\nSpearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated between weather variables and the notified number of cases on a weekly basis. Lagged effects of climatic variables were explored through correlation analysis. The study employed a Poisson regression model to account for autocorrelation, seasonality, and lag effects.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nAdelaide, with a Mediterranean climate, and Brisbane, with a sub-tropical climate, were the focus of this study. The primary Poisson regression model was adjusted for autocorrelation and included variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and seasonal effects.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe results indicated a significant association between weather variables and Campylobacter infections, suggesting that environmental factors play a crucial role in the incidence of enteric infections.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between weather variables and enteric infections, which can inform public health strategies for controlling these diseases in different climatic regions of Australia.\\n---\\n# Weather and Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Weather and Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nFigure 1: Geographic location and climatic zones of Brisbane and Adelaide, Australia.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Description of Campylobacter Infections in Brisbane and Adelaide, 1990-2005\\n\\nIn Adelaide, there were 20,211 notified cases of Campylobacter infection over the study period, with 20.12% of notified cases occurring in children under 5 years. There is no consistent seasonal distribution; however, averaging across years reveals that major peak weeks over the study period occurred between weeks 45 and 48 (late spring), and between weeks 28 and 33 in winter.\\n\\nIn Brisbane, there were 14,697 notified Campylobacter infections over the study period. Similar to Adelaide, there is no clear seasonal distribution. However, on average, major peak weeks over the study period occurred between weeks 40 and 47 (late spring), and between weeks 52 and 2 in summer. This seasonal difference suggests that different causal mechanisms may be occurring in the two cities.\\n\\nTemperatures and weekly notifications of Campylobacter infections showed the highest correlation coefficients with a lag of 9 weeks, while rainfall was correlated at a marginal level. Relative humidity was positively associated with the number of cases with a lag of 14 weeks.\\n\\nThe time-series adjusted Poisson regression Model II, using minimum temperature as an explanatory variable, is not presented in this paper due to its great similarity to Model I with maximum temperature.\\n\\n**Table 2: Summary of Campylobacter Infections in Adelaide**\\n|Variable|Effect|\\n|---|---|\\n|Weekly Maximum Temperature|Inverse effect on infections|\\n|Rainfall|Positive effect|\\n|Relative Humidity|Not significant|\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 4, the estimated/expected number of cases from Model I fits very well with the observed number of cases in Adelaide for the period 1990-2005, including the peak values. In the diagnosis of the residuals of the model, a random distribution was observed with no autocorrelation among them.\\n\\n# Weather and Campylobacter Infection in Brisbane\\n\\nTable 3 indicates that there was a positive correlation in Brisbane between mean weekly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall with weekly new notifications of Campylobacter infections, with a 6-week lag.\\n---\\n# Annual Trends of Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Annual Trends of Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nFigure 2: Annual trend of the number of cases of Campylobacter infections in Adelaide, 1990-2005.\\n\\nFigure 3: Annual trend of the number of notified cases of Campylobacter infection in Brisbane, 1990-2005.\\n---\\n# Weather and Campylobacter Infections'),\n",

Our results indicate that the seasonal distribution of the number of cases varied in these different climatic areas. After controlling for the seasonal variation, the lag effects, and long-term trends, the results suggest that maximum temperature has a positive association with the weekly notifications of Campylobacter infections, while relative humidity has a negative relationship. Rainfall was not significant and excluded from the model.\\n\\nThe seasonal distribution of Campylobacter infections may vary in different geographic, latitude, and climatic regions. A recent international study indicated that many populations have a peak in spring, while other studies have shown different seasonal distributions in countries with varying climates.\\n\\n# Table 2: Parameters Estimated by Time-Series Adjusted Poisson Model I for Campylobacter Infections in Adelaide\\n\\n| |Coefficient|Std.

The associations between temperatures and Campylobacter infection in the two cities of our study indicate that weather may be one of the contributing factors for Campylobacter infection, although the direction of the association is different. The possible underlying causes of the different directions of association between the two cities might include the different local weather conditions and their impacts on local animal reservoirs or food processing activities. Unlike Brisbane with a humid sub-tropical climate, Adelaide has a typical Mediterranean climate with wet, mild winters and dry, hot summers. The different seasonal distribution of the cases indicates the possible different impacts of the local climate on the transmission of the infection.\\n\\nThe length of the lag before the effects of temperature were observed were similar in the two cities (up to six or nine weeks) and could be due to the role that temperatures play in the transmission of this disease by affecting processes in the food chain, including the farm, the processing plant, or the home, thus having an impact on the risk of infection. This was a little longer than the study results in Denmark, where a positive association was identified between temperature and Campylobacter infections, with a four-week lagged effect. While, in the international study by Kovats et al. on the relationship between temperature and peak-time of Campylobacter cases, a lag time of more than two months was reported. The lag time could vary in different areas depending on local weather conditions and food processing. Relatively longer lags could indicate the significance of the conditions earlier in the food production process, e.g., animal husbandry and slaughtering or processing and distribution, rather than the importance of food storage and hygiene close to the point of consumption.\\n\\nAs Campylobacter does not survive very well in dry conditions, high relative humidity and/or rainfall may contribute to the survival of these organisms in the environment. In this study, we did not find a consistent relationship between rainfall and Campylobacter infections in the two cities. Rainfall was significant in the regression model in Adelaide, which is the first time this has been reported in such studies. However, the effect was not significant in Brisbane. Relative humidity was significantly associated with Campylobacter infections in Brisbane but not in Adelaide. This could be because Adelaide had higher levels of disease recorded in winter (its wetter season) and Brisbane had higher levels in summer (its season of higher relative humidity).'),\n",

This could be because Adelaide had higher levels of disease recorded in winter (its wetter season) and Brisbane had higher levels in summer (its season of higher relative humidity).\\n\\nIt is of significance to find different relationships between weather variables and Campylobacter infections in the two Australian cities with different climates. Though weather, in particular temperature, may affect the growth of food-borne pathogens, this is probably not a factor of importance in Campylobacter epidemiology, as far as the food processing chain is maintained at an effective cool level. However, weather may impact on reservoirs, e.g., animals and human eating behaviour, as well as, at least sometimes, food transportation and people’s kitchen. The study by Kovats et al. did not find a strong effect of temperature variability on the infections at either the short-time scale or at longer-time scales. This suggests that more studies are necessary to identify the relationship between temperatures and Campylobacter infections, especially in different climatic regions.\\n\\nIn both Adelaide and Brisbane, the regression models indicate that the number of new cases in a given week could be related to the number of cases in previous weeks. This may provide an indicator to local community and health authorities. As soon as an increase in cases is detected by a surveillance system, preventive public health action could be initiated by an early warning system and educating the meat industry and the local community to conduct relevant health promotion campaigns so as to change people’s behaviors.\\n\\nWeekly disease surveillance data rather than monthly data were used in this study and it was an appropriate choice. Monthly data might not be able to provide up-to-date information for food-borne disease, and would be less sensitive in detecting any climate impacts. Daily data were too scarce to run appropriate analyses. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of weekly data in similar studies.\\n\\n# Table 4: Parameters Estimated by Time-Series Adjusted Poisson Model I for Campylobacter Infections in Brisbane\\n\\n|Variable|Coef.|Std.

In addition, date of onset, rather than date of notification was used in the study, which would be expected to provide a more accurate estimation of the relationship between weather variables and disease outcome.\\n\\nThe transmission of Campylobacter is a complicated ecological process with multiple hosts and routes involved. A wide range of animals and birds comprise the reservoirs of Campylobacter and many external environmental factors including weather factors may affect this cycle. There are also many risk factors for Campylobacter infections among human beings. For instance, poor handling or consumption of raw or undercooked chicken meat may account for approximately 30% of Campylobacter cases each year in Australia. Temperature might impact on Campylobacter carriage and/or the sources of contamination within the farm environment, such as migratory birds, beetles, and rodents, which are temperature dependent.\\n\\nWeather variables might also influence the whole Campylobacter infection transmission process, including any animal reservoirs, animal/human interaction, and human-to-human contact.\\n\\nLimitations of this study should be acknowledged. Underreporting of food-borne diseases is inevitable in any infectious disease surveillance system, but there is no reason to suspect that this introduces any systematic biases because it is believed that underreporting was consistent over the study period. In addition, further studies including more local influencing factors, such as socio-economic status and public health services, would be important to fully understand the causes of the various effects of weather variables on such diseases.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the seasonal distribution of Campylobacter infections in the Australian cities studied is different. After controlling for seasonality, this study indicates that temperature could be an environmental factor that affects the transmission of Campylobacter infections, although the direction of the association could be different depending on climatic region.

Parashar, MB BS, MPH\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nA substantial number of surveillance studies have documented rotavirus prevalence among children admitted for dehydrating diarrhea. We sought to establish global seasonal patterns of rotavirus disease before the introduction of widespread vaccination. In a review of 34 studies conducted before 1990, Cook et al found that rotavirus infection typically occurred during the winter months of the year in temperate regions, whereas year-round patterns were common in the warmer tropical regions. Attempts to find a link between seasonal incidence of rotavirus disease and many aspects of climate, such as temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and barometric pressure, have yielded conflicting findings.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nWe reviewed studies of rotavirus detection in children with diarrhea published since 1995. We assessed potential relationships between seasonal prevalence and locality by plotting the average monthly proportion of diarrhea cases positive for rotavirus according to geography, country development, and latitude. We used linear regression to identify variables that were potentially associated with the seasonal intensity of rotavirus.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nAmong a total of 99 studies representing all 6 geographic regions of the world, patterns of year-round disease were more evident in low- and low-middle income countries compared with upper-middle and high-income countries where disease was more likely to be seasonal. The level of country development was a stronger predictor of strength of seasonality (P = 0.001) than geographic location or climate. However, the observation of distinctly different seasonal patterns of rotavirus disease in some countries with similar geographic location, climate, and level of development indicates that a single unifying explanation for variation in seasonality of rotavirus disease is unlikely.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWhile no unifying explanation emerged for varying rotavirus seasonality globally, the country income level was somewhat more predictive of the likelihood of having seasonal disease than other factors. Future evaluation of the effect of rotavirus vaccination on seasonal patterns of disease in different settings may help understand factors that drive the global seasonality of rotavirus disease. We used the wealth of information that has recently become available to review the global prevalence of rotavirus disease before the widespread use of recently available rotavirus vaccines. In addition, we reexamined the influence of localities on the seasonality of rotavirus disease on a global scale.\\n\\nKey Words:\\n\\nrotavirus, seasonality, season, diarrhea, global, surveillance\\n\\nAccepted for publication November 8, 2012.\\n\\nFrom the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ; Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; and Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT.\\n\\nThis work was partially supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the RAPIDD program of the Science & Technology Directorate, Department of Homeland Security and the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health (VeP).

We included studies from both inpatient and outpatient settings because seasonality is not expected to vary by treatment setting. If studies reported data from more than 1 city, we considered results from each city as a separate data point. We restricted our analysis to studies published since 1995 because studies before this date have previously been reviewed and because, since the mid-1990s, most studies have used sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassays when conducting surveillance for rotavirus, typically using the standardized surveillance methods recommended by the World Health Organization. Eligible studies were selected and abstracted by a single author and reviewed by another author. For each study that satisfied our criteria, we recorded the study city, country, duration, age of enrollees, proportion of rotavirus-positive results by month and the number of specimens tested and number of positive results if available.\\n\\nMost studies provided proportion of diarrhea events positive for rotavirus, rather than the absolute numbers of rotavirus-positive tests. Among the few studies that presented both, the seasonal pattern of rotavirus infection was similar. For studies longer than 12 months in duration, we averaged the proportion of diarrhea events positive for rotavirus during each month.\\n\\n# Data Analysis\\n\\nPrevious studies have determined that seasonality of rotavirus disease may vary by region. To assess potential relationships between seasonal prevalence and locality, we plotted the average monthly proportion of diarrhea cases positive for rotavirus according to 3 inter-related groups: geographic area, level of country development and latitude. First, we grouped studies according to 6 geographic regions of the world: North and Central America, South America, Asia, Africa, Europe and Oceania. Second, we grouped studies according to the World Bank income stratification for the country represented by each study: low and low-middle income, high-middle income and high-income countries. By summing monthly prevalence data across regions with rotavirus detection during opposing seasons could be misinterpreted as “year-round” disease. Thus, the grouping of studies by income level was restricted to the Northern Hemisphere and the tropical belt (i.e., latitudes 10° north and 10° south of the equator), where peak prevalence of disease was between December and May, and ignored countries in the Southern Hemisphere where peak prevalence of rotavirus disease occurred during May to October. Third, we grouped studies according to latitudes with broadly similar seasons: 36–70° north, 11–35° north, 10° north–10° south, 11–35° south and 36–55° south. To account for the undue influence of studies with a smaller sample, the pooled averages for these groups were weighted according to study size.'),\n",

To characterize seasonal variability in rotavirus disease, we used an indicator of “seasonal intensity” which is the ratio of amplitude of peak rotavirus activity (i.e., peak monthly prevalence of rotavirus) to the average annual prevalence of rotavirus. This ratio reduces noise from months with little or no rotavirus testing in some settings. Higher seasonal intensity reflected greater deviation from the annual mean, and thus greater seasonal variation. We also explored the seasonality patterns of each site by measuring the amplitude (peak – trough/peak) and primary peak timing of the “average” year calculated using Fourier analysis. Briefly, by this method, we extracted the frequencies of the first (annual), second (semiannual) and third (quarterly) harmonics in the data, which were then summed to produce the seasonal signature of the series. Amplitudes and primary peak timings of each site were inspected against their corresponding latitudes.\\n\\nWe used multivariable linear regression to identify independent variables that were potentially associated with the seasonal intensity of rotavirus. Possible predictors were identified on the basis of previous studies and hypotheses for explaining rotavirus seasonality. These included temperature, rainfall, altitude, geographic location (latitude), population density and level of country development as measured by 2001’s gross national income (GNI) per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity, retaining all variables in the final model. Birth rate was considered as a potential explanatory variable but was not included due to collinearity with GNI. Including study size in the model did not alter the findings and thus was not retained in the final model. Weather data on weather, latitude and altitude were abstracted from information service. For cities that were not listed in the weather databases, meteorological information was based on a nearby city within the same climatic region. For studies that reported aggregate results of multiple cities, the average weather pattern was calculated. GNI per capita based on purchasing power parity was obtained from the World Bank. The year of 2001 was chosen as it is the average year of the focused studies. Analyses were conducted using Matlab and SAS.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nWe reviewed 522 abstracts to identify a total of 186 potential studies, from which 99 studies (representing 153 separate study sites) met the inclusion criteria of our analysis. These studies represented all 6 regions of the world, with sites being most common in Asia (59%) and South America (20%), and less common in Europe (8%), Africa (7%), North/Central America (4%) and Oceania (3%). Most studies had similar methodology in that they followed the World Health Organization recommendations for conducting rotavirus surveillance, used enzyme linked immunoassays to detect rotavirus and limited the sample population to children less than 5 years of age. Studies reported data from the hospital setting (83%), outpatient setting (3%) or both (14%). In total, these studies reported data on ~428,000 samples of stool from children with diarrhea, of which ~111,000 (26%) tested positive for rotavirus.\\n\\nWhen studies were examined by regions, in general, detection of rotavirus occurred year-round in Africa, Asia and South America, with some month-to-month fluctuations. In these continents, the mean prevalence of rotavirus ranged between 31–48% during peak month and 15–23% during the nadir (i.e., lowest prevalence) month. In contrast, seasonality was stronger in Europe, North America and Oceania, with prevalence of disease ranging between 37–60% during peak winter months and 4–11% during the nadir summer months. Detection of rotavirus overlapped with the winter months (November–April) in higher northern latitudes, and the peak times in the tropical belt were also in phase with the peak times of higher latitudes. In contrast, peak prevalence in the Southern Hemisphere (below 10° south) typically occurred between May and October, the winter months in this hemisphere. The intensity of seasonality was quite strong through all latitudes, although overall a bit lower in the tropical belt, where the monthly prevalence never dropped below 33%, compared with countries further north or south of these latitudes where minimum monthly prevalence ranged between 11% and 22%.\\n\\nWhen countries were grouped according to their level of economic development, the low- and low-middle income countries had a higher mean minimum prevalence of rotavirus.\\n---\\nPatel et al                                                            The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal           •  Volume 32, Number 4, April 2013\\n\\nTABLE 1.

Our review of a large body of data published since the paper by Cook et al identified that such a clear distinction between seasonal patterns in tropical and temperate settings may not exist, as many countries in the tropics exhibited very seasonal disease patterns whereas several temperate countries showed year-round disease. The level of country development was a stronger predictor of seasonal intensity of rotavirus disease than latitude or geographic location per se—poorer countries, particularly those in Africa, Asia, and South America had lesser seasonal variation in disease than more developed countries from Europe, North America, and Oceania, even after taking into account local climate and geographic location. These data are not in complete disagreement with findings by Cook et al in that tropical countries are, in general, less developed than those in temperate regions. Our findings are also consistent with a recent modeling study by Pitzer et al that demonstrated that high transmission rates and high birth rates, factors common to poor countries, explained, in part, a relative lack of seasonality in these countries.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n.data-table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.data-table th, .data-table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.data-table th {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\n# Volume 32, Number 4, April 2013\\n\\nFIGURE 1.

As shown in Figure 3, the primary peak overlaps with cooler months in higher latitudes. Surprisingly, regions with tropical climates, such as Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, exhibit a year-round presence of rotavirus disease, while temperate regions like North America and Western Europe show a concentration of disease during winter months.\\n\\nFigure 3. Timing of the primary peak of rotavirus disease globally, by latitude. Colors denote continents to which each point belongs and size of circle is proportion to the number of months rotavirus was in circulation.\\n\\nInterestingly, some tropical countries, such as Kenya and El Salvador, also display notable seasonal disease patterns similar to wealthier countries in temperate climates, like the United States. This suggests that while local climate may influence seasonal cycling of rotavirus disease, it is not the sole factor.\\n\\n# Amplitude of Seasonal Signature\\n\\nFigure 4. Amplitude of the primary peak of the seasonal signature of the series as a function of latitude. Amplitude is peak trough/peak ratio. Colors denote continents to which each point belongs.\\n\\nThe consistent yearly peaks of rotavirus suggest that additional factors beyond climate are at play in determining the prevalence of this disease.\\n\\n© 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\\n\\nPublished in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, Volume 32, Number 4, April 2013.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\n#\\n# The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal\\n\\n# Volume 32, Number 4, April 2013\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns and Influencing Factors\\n\\nThe timing and regularity of rotavirus patterns that cycle annually (potentially related to weather) must play a role underpinning the timing and regularity of patterns. However, any single explanation for seasonal differences in rotavirus disease globally is difficult to reconcile with these observations.\\n\\nAt a regional level, many factors may interact and explain seasonality including climate, transmission patterns, host behavior, and susceptibility. The influence of these factors may also be context-specific. It is possible that multiple factors related to socioeconomic status contribute to the observed seasonality.\\n\\n# Income Group Analysis\\n\\nThe following data illustrates the seasonal variation in rotavirus in tropical and northern temperate zones, categorized by World Bank income groups:\\n\\n- Low or lower middle income: Avg-39% (5196 cases)\\n- Upper middle income: Avg-34% (1896 cases)\\n- High income: Avg-14% (407 cases)\\n\\nThe analysis was restricted to studies conducted in the Northern Hemisphere and the tropical belt (i.e., latitudes 10° North and 10° South of the equator) to avoid falsely representing seasonality by summing monthly prevalence across regions with peak rotavirus detections during opposing seasons, which would result in a bias toward weaker seasonality.\\n\\nFIGURE 5.

Seasonality in high-middle and high-income countries, by latitude.\\n\\nTransmission interact in some settings and have opposing climatic influences. For instance, contaminated water may be an important source of transmission in settings with poor sanitation. Rotavirus can be isolated from water sources, and waterborne outbreaks of rotavirus have been described. Furthermore, some studies have noted secondary seasonal peaks in rotavirus incidence associated with periods of high rainfall and flooding. The waterborne transmission route may dominate during times of increased rainfall in such settings, whereas more direct forms of transmission may dominate during the cooler, drier seasons (when virus survival is increased) across all settings. Rotavirus strains also tend to be more diverse in low-income settings. Although no data exist assessing the variation in seasonality between the different rotavirus serotypes, factors driving the global seasonality of influenza have been determined to differ between the specific types and subtypes of the influenza virus. Similar differences between different strains of rotavirus, if they were to exist, might partly explain the weaker seasonality in low-income settings.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doi': 'paper 10.1097/INF.0b013e31827d3b68 31'}, page_content='Some limitations must be considered when interpreting our results. Although we provided a descriptive account of differences in seasonality of rotavirus by region, we did not explicitly account for factors such as local transmission dynamics; a closer examination of regional data may provide an explanation for the timing of onset and variation in disease in any given country or geographic region. Furthermore, we only examined associations between a crude indicator of seasonality and possible predictors. A more detailed examination of the associations between annual variation in rotavirus prevalence in each setting and possible predictors, taking into account population immunity, possible lags and the nonlinear effects of transmission, was beyond the scope of the current study and would require more detailed data. Heterogeneity in data quality is likely to exist given the large number of studies. However, of specific importance to our objective is that most studies in the past decade have used validated diagnostic assays and a similar case definition for diarrhea, and were conducted for a minimum of 12 calendar months among children less than 5 years of age.\\n\\nAnother potential limitation is that most studies presented monthly prevalence of rotavirus detection (proportion of tests positive) among children with diarrhea rather than the actual number of events. Monthly prevalence of rotavirus might be affected by the incidence of nonrotavirus pathogens, which will influence the number of acute gastroenteritis events that are tested. However, our conclusions were unchanged when we assessed this potential effect in a subset of studies that presented both case counts and percent of tests positive for rotavirus. Last, the number of children enrolled in individual studies varied markedly. To account for the undue influence of studies with a smaller sample, we used weighted averages when pooling data across regions; however, patterns of seasonality remained unchanged when we used unweighted averages.\\n\\nMany countries, mostly developed countries with seasonal disease, have already introduced rotavirus vaccines, and introductions are expected in poorer regions of Asia and Africa in coming years. Changes in seasonality of rotavirus disease after large-scale rollout of rotavirus vaccines particularly in countries with year-round disease versus highly seasonal disease should allow us to test the various proposed hypotheses for the seasonal cycling of rotavirus disease. For example, Pitzer et al have demonstrated through modeling that variation in birth rates within the United States strongly influences the timing and spread of the annual rotavirus epidemic.\\n\\n© 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins\\n\\nwww.pidj.com\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Rotavirus Seasonality\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n.figure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality and Its Influencing Factors\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nStudies have observed a remarkable alteration in the timing of the annual winter epidemic and spatiotemporal spread of rotavirus disease.

Observations from several countries challenged the traditional dogma that rotavirus disease is seasonal in temperate settings but not in tropical countries. We found that country income level was somewhat more predictive of the likelihood of having seasonal disease than other factors. However, the observations of distinctly different seasonal patterns of rotavirus disease in some countries with similar geographic location, climate and level of development are difficult to reconcile, indicating that a single unifying explanation for variation in seasonality of rotavirus disease is unlikely. Higher birth rates and higher transmission rates have emerged as a potential explanation for sustained year-round circulation of rotavirus, but an interaction of other local factors between the host and the environment likely also contribute to the seasonality.\\n\\n# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nThe findings and conclusions of this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

M. Hahnéa, Patricia Bruijning-Verhagenb, and Jacco Wallingac\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nRotavirus is a common viral infection among young children. As in many countries, the infection dynamics of rotavirus in the Netherlands are characterized by an annual winter peak, which was notably low in 2014. Previous study suggested an association between weather factors and both rotavirus transmission and incidence. From epidemic theory, we know that the proportion of susceptible individuals can affect disease transmission. We investigated how these factors are associated with rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands, and their impact on rotavirus transmission in 2014. We used available data on birth rates and rotavirus laboratory reports to estimate rotavirus transmission and the proportion of individuals susceptible to primary infection. Weather data were directly available from a central meteorological station. We developed an approach for detecting determinants of seasonal rotavirus transmission by assessing nonlinear, delayed associations between each factor and rotavirus transmission. We explored relationships by applying a distributed lag nonlinear regression model with seasonal terms. We corrected for residual serial correlation using autoregressive moving average errors. We inferred the relationship between different factors and the effective reproduction number from the most parsimonious model with low residual autocorrelation. Higher proportions of susceptible individuals and lower temperatures were associated with increases in rotavirus transmission. For 2014, our findings suggest that relatively mild temperatures combined with the low proportion of susceptible individuals contributed to lower rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands. However, our model, which overestimated the magnitude of the peak, suggested that other factors were likely instrumental in reducing the incidence that year.\\n\\nSubmitted: 19 April 2016; Accepted: 14 March 2017.\\n\\nThe authors report no conflicts of interest.\\n\\n# Affiliations\\n\\naCenter for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, The Netherlands;\\n\\nbJulius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands;\\n\\ncDepartment of Medical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.\\n\\n# Statement on Availability of Data and Code for Replication\\n\\nFor access to the data and computing code to replicate the results published in this manuscript, please contact the corresponding author (RDvG).\\n\\nSupplemental digital content is available through direct URL citations in the HTML and PDF versions of this article (www.epidem.com).\\n\\n# Correspondence\\n\\nRolina D. van Gaalen, RIVM, EPI Postbak 75, P.O.

No ethical approval was required. Original time series data on the weighted reported rotavirus incidence, maximum daily temperature, maximum absolute humidity, ultraviolet light, rainfall, and birth rate are shown in Figure 1. Note the low reported rotavirus incidence in 2014, which coincided with a relatively mild winter. In addition to the clear yearly trend observed in each time series plot, the daily number of births gradually decreased over time. We expected the temperature and the proportion of susceptible individuals to directly affect rotavirus transmission. We additionally evaluated the effect of variables for which we did not expect to observe an association, including ultraviolet light, rainfall, and absolute humidity. We did not assess the effect of school vacations because most primary infections occur before children are old enough to attend school.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Estimating the Proportion of Susceptible Individuals\\n\\nThe primary infection with rotavirus is the most likely to be symptomatic and severe. Therefore, in calculating the proportion of susceptible individuals from the weekly number of reported rotavirus cases, we made two assumptions: (1) the majority of cases represented in our reported rotavirus incidence data were of primary infections and (2) individuals were removed from the population at risk for severe infection after their primary infection. Sensitivity of our results to this second assumption was assessed in eAppendix E. Because infants younger than 6 months are generally protected from rotavirus infection due possibly to maternal immunity, children older than 6 months who had never been infected constituted the susceptible population in our analysis.\\n\\nThe infection dynamics described above are akin to a standard epidemic susceptible-infected-recovered model, common in mathematical modeling. The absolute number of susceptible individuals for any given week was calculated as the number of susceptible individuals at the start of follow-up, plus the cumulative number of individuals older than 6 months of age from the start of our time series to week t subtracted by the cumulative number of rotavirus cases from the start of our time series to week t. We estimated S0 as the average expected duration in the susceptible class (9 months) times the average daily number of new susceptible individuals in 1999.\\n\\n# Weather Data\\n\\nData on the maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature and absolute humidity, ultraviolet light, and rainfall from January 1, 1950 to December 31, 2015 were available from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. We used data from the meteorological station in De Bilt, located in the middle of the Netherlands and considered representative for the country.\\n\\n# Number of Births\\n\\nData on the daily number of births in the Netherlands from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2013 were obtained from Statistics Netherlands. For 2014–2015, only monthly birth rate data were available. Daily birth rate data for these years were estimated using the available monthly data and the daily trends from previous years. To estimate the proportion of case ascertainment at each week, we used local linear regression of births versus rotavirus cases.\\n\\nFigure 1: Time series data on rotavirus incidence and weather factors.\\n\\n© 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

For our main analysis, we set to 9 months the average time that individuals are expected to be susceptible to primary infection. In eAppendix E, we tested the sensitivity of our results to alternative average durations in the susceptible class.\\n\\n# Preliminary Analyses: Granger Causality\\n\\nWe adjusted the number of reported cases for under-ascertainment to arrive at a balance equation for the number of susceptible individuals:\\n\\nS(t) = S0 + ∑i=1t (αi * Ir(i))\\n\\nFor the number of lags that optimized model fit according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). A factor is considered to Granger-cause log Rt if at least one βi is statistically different from zero. Our analyses suggested a Granger causal association between log Rt and all factors considered except rainfall. Notice that because the Granger model does not account for seasonality, it may detect spurious associations.\\n\\n# Preliminary Analyses: Simulation Study\\n\\nUsing simulations, we assessed the effect of correcting for residual serial correlation. Our analyses demonstrated that failing to account for serial correlation increased the probability of identifying an association when there was none (i.e., increased false positive rate), while accounting for serial correlation improved the probability of correctly identifying the nature of associations.\\n\\n# Estimating the Effective Reproduction Number of Rotavirus\\n\\nThe effective reproduction number, Rt, measures the number of secondary cases infected per primary case at time t and can be calculated as:\\n\\nRt = ∑u=t∞ Iu * gu-t\\n\\nWhere Iu is the rotavirus infection incidence at time u, and gu is the probability density of the generation interval distribution at time u. The mean of the generation interval was 2.1 days (SD = 0.9), which agrees with the estimated rotavirus incubation period of 2 days.\\n\\n# Regression Model\\n\\nFor our main analysis, we used a regression model to first assess the linear immediate and 1-week delayed association between each factor and log Rt. We then tested for non-linear and delayed associations using flexible natural splines. We adjusted for yearly (seasonal) correlation using sine and cosine terms with a period of 52.2 weeks.\\n\\nlog(Rt) = β0 + f(xt) + ∑i=1k σisin(2π.it/52.2) + ∑i=1k σicos(2π.it/52.2) + ηt\\n\\nIn this equation, β0 is the underlying constant level of rotavirus transmission in the Dutch population over time, and each σi represents the seasonal effect contributed by the corresponding sine or cosine term.\\n\\n© 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

For each factor included in the regression model, the selected functional form yielded optimal model fit (lowest AIC).\\n\\n# Accounting for Serial Correlation\\n\\nAs written, the ordinary regression model (Equation 2) assumes independent residuals, which is generally an invalid assumption for time series analyses. We augmented Equation 2 to automatically correct the regression estimates for autocorrelation, such that the residuals were modeled using autoregressive moving average terms:\\n\\nη(t) = (1 + ∑i=1p φi Bi) ε(t) + (1 + ∑i=1q θi Bi)\\n\\nwhere the p autoregressive terms account for correlation between p consecutive weeks, the q moving average terms account for correlation between the regression errors between q consecutive weeks, η(t) refers to the error terms from the regression equation (Equation 2), and ε(t) denotes normally and independently distributed error terms. Note that Bi η(t) = η(t−i) and Bi ε(t) = ε(t−i). For a given (set of) factor(s) and prespecified values for ms, mc, p, q, and k, all coefficients of these regression models, Equations 2 and 3, were iteratively estimated using the Arima function in R 3.1.0 such that model fit was optimized (lowest AIC).\\n\\n# Model Selection\\n\\nAlong with analyses using one factor in the regression model (“univariate” analyses), we combined the different factors into one multivariate model to assess the combined effect. The best model was the one that had the lowest AIC and relatively low (partial) autocorrelation. We used Q–Q plots to ensure that our final model had normally distributed errors.\\n\\nFinally, we used a 28-week moving average of the results of the regression model (Equation 2) to suggest time periods where the model was insufficient to explain, on average, the observed trends in the effective reproduction number. Further details are provided in eAppendix B (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B186).\\n\\nAll statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.1.0, using the tseries, splines, INLA, forecast, and dlnm packages. Example code is provided in eAppendix C (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B186).\\n\\n# RESULTS\\n\\n# Estimated Proportion of Susceptible Individuals and Effective Reproduction Number\\n\\nWe estimated that approximately 150,000 individuals in the Netherlands were susceptible to rotavirus at the start of our time series. An estimate of the proportion of susceptible individuals over time (Figure 2) shows that the proportion of susceptible individuals generally peaks just before the start of a new rotavirus season when rotavirus incidence is still low (December–January) and reaches a trough at the end of the rotavirus season (April–May). An anomaly was observed in 2014, where the proportion of susceptible individuals continued to increase well into the usual epidemic months, and peaked when rotavirus incidence (mildly) peaked that year. The gradual decline was partially caused by a reduced influx of new susceptible individuals (6-month-olds) in the first half of 2014. In Figure 3, we plotted the time-dependent log effective reproduction number of rotavirus calculated using Bayesian integrated nested Laplace approximations models, which was the outcome in our analyses. Clear seasonal patterns were observed in Figures 2 and 3.\\n\\nFIGURE 2.

Optimal model fit was obtained when a delay of up to 2 weeks for temperature and when a delay of up to 3 weeks for the log proportion of susceptible individuals were included in the model (eFigure 16; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B186). Delayed effects were also modeled using a natural cubic spline with three degrees of freedom.\\n\\nThe effect of the proportions of susceptible individuals fluctuated from week to week. Therefore, we calculated the total current and delayed effect of each proportion of susceptible individuals. We observed that weeks with higher proportions of susceptible individuals were associated with a higher effective reproduction number (eFigure 16a; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B186). Furthermore, the shapes of splines suggest that lower temperatures in the current and previous week were associated with a higher log R(t) (eFigure 16b–d; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B186).\\n\\nThere was no evidence of an immediate or delayed association between ultraviolet light, rainfall, and absolute humidity and log R(t) (eFigure 16e–i; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B186).\\n\\nNext, we considered multivariate models that accounted for seasonality and serial correlation. The model with the best fit, and therefore selected as our final model, included the log proportion of susceptible individuals and mean temperature, modeling their effects using a natural cubic spline with three degrees of freedom. Optimal model fit was obtained when temperature with a delay of up to 2 weeks and the log proportion of susceptible individuals with a delay of up to 3 weeks were included in the model.\\n\\nWe combined the estimated effects of the proportion of susceptible individuals and of mean temperature on the effective reproduction number to arrive at an estimated critical threshold, where R(t) = 1. Assuming a negligible effect of seasonality and serial correlation on R(t), this critical threshold suggests the proportion of susceptible individuals and the mean temperature for which an epidemic could change from increasing to decreasing incidence. The shaded region in Figure 5 shows the proportion of susceptible individuals and the mean temperature for which our model suggests this critical shift could occur.\\n\\nFor example, a proportion of susceptible individuals equal to 0.10 may be sufficient to reduce the effective reproduction number to below one for all mean temperatures.\\n\\nCopyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The black line represents the estimated effect, and the grey region indicates the 95% confidence intervals.\\n\\nThe explanatory value of the proportion of susceptible individuals and mean temperature in estimating log R(t) time trends show a clear seasonal trend (Figure 6). Together these two factors alone explain up to the total magnitude of log R(t) at its peak (Figure 7A). The year 2014 was an anomaly: the unusually low rotavirus incidence during the 2014 season left the highest proportion of individuals susceptible to infection at the end of the rotavirus season in the 15 years for which data were available (Figures 2 and 6A). The high proportion of susceptible individuals suggests that epidemic-level rotavirus transmission (R(t) > 1) could have continued into the summer, and perhaps through most of the year (Figure 6A). When considering this factor along with temperature, it appears as though the warmer summer weather reduced the effective reproduction number to below one.\\n\\nFigure 5. The proportion of susceptible individuals and the mean temperature for which our model suggests an increasing incidence (effective reproduction number above one; in grey) and a decreasing incidence (below one; in white), assuming the effect of the seasonality on the effective reproduction number was equal to one and the effect of serial correlation equals one. Dashed lines depict the 95% confidence interval.\\n\\nThe proportion of susceptible individuals, mean temperature, and seasonal effects alone did not completely capture the week-to-week variability in the effective reproduction number (Figure 7B). When we additionally considered the effects of temperatures above 6.7°C (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5°C, 9.3°C; Figure 5), we observed a closer approximation of the week-to-week variability (Figure 7C). When the estimated combined effect of the proportion of susceptible individuals, mean temperature, and seasonal factors were averaged over 28 weeks, we observed that they generally followed the trends.\\n\\n© 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The 28-week moving average of the estimated effective reproduction number of rotavirus (grey) and the 28-week moving average of estimates of the final model that included the log average weekly proportion of susceptible individuals, the average weekly mean temperature, and the estimated effect of seasonality (black).\\n\\nObserved in the United States can be partially explained by yearly birth rate patterns. They suggested that even a small seasonal variation in rotavirus transmission—driven, for example, by weather factors—may be sufficient to result in strong rotavirus seasonality. Atchison et al. demonstrated an association between temperature and rotavirus transmission, but no association with absolute humidity. Other population-based and laboratory studies have similarly shown that rotavirus incidence and virus survival are associated with temperature. Studies found contradictory results on the association between other weather factors (such as rainfall and relative/absolute humidity) and rotavirus incidence, which could be explained by the settings in which the studies were conducted and the variability of humidity in those settings.\\n\\nThe method that we developed for detecting determinants of seasonal rotavirus transmission by assessing nonlinear, delayed associations—distributed lag nonlinear models that account for seasonality and adjust for autoregressive moving average errors—provides an approach for investigating the determinants of (seasonal) disease transmission. Inspired by time series susceptible-infected-recovered models, this model allows for flexible parameter estimation and accounts for seasonal and serial correlation as in autoregressive moving average modeling, while focusing on the disease transmission process. Regression models that rely on time series data, but that fail to account for serial correlation, neglect a key assumption in regression analysis, namely, that the calculation of confidence intervals assumes that the residuals generated by a regression model are white noise. Removing seasonal and serial correlation reduces the possibility of arriving at spurious associations between two variables and may thereby result in a loss of significance of originally identified, logically attractive variables. As we showed in our simulation analyses, ordinary regression analysis detects spurious associations in serially correlated data, and serial correlation correction using autoregressive moving average error terms does not hinder the ability to detect an association. Our contribution was to introduce a test on statistical footing and firmly establish that there are associations between the effective reproductive number of rotavirus and both temperature and the proportion of susceptible individuals, but not absolute humidity.\\n\\nA limitation of our analysis was that we relied on reconstructed data, which could have biased our results. We reconstructed the proportion of susceptible individuals by estimating the number of individuals infected in the population. Because laboratory tests are not conducted on all individuals with a primary rotavirus infection, reported weekly incidence statistics, the assumption that all individuals are infected with rotavirus, and an estimate of the time-varying reporting fraction were used to inform our estimate of the true weekly national incidence of rotavirus. Moreover, the ages of the reported rotavirus cases were unavailable in our dataset. Therefore, we assumed that all reported cases were of primary infections in children under 5 years of age and that the primary infection with rotavirus occurs at 15 months of age, on average. No data were available to further inform our model.\\n\\nBased on our findings, it would appear as though the relatively mild temperatures in 2014 combined with the low proportion of susceptible individuals contributed to lower rotavirus transmission in the Netherlands that same year, and, more generally, that temperature and the proportion of susceptible individuals has an impact on rotavirus transmission from year to year. However, the fact that the modeled effective reproduction number in 2014 was higher than what was expected suggests further investigation is warranted.\\n\\n© 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the scarcity of evidence about how individual environmental factors affect transmission of specific pathogens makes prediction of trends under different climate scenarios challenging. We aimed to model associations between daily estimates of a suite of hydrometeorological variables and rotavirus infection status ascertained through community-based surveillance.\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nFor this analysis of multisite cohort data, rotavirus infection status was ascertained through community-based surveillance of infants in the eight-site MAL-ED cohort study, and matched by date with earth observation estimates of nine hydrometeorological variables from the Global Land Data Assimilation System: daily total precipitation volume (mm), daily total surface runoff (mm), surface pressure (mbar), wind speed (m/s), relative humidity (%), soil moisture (%), solar radiation (W/m²), specific humidity (kg/kg), and average daily temperatures (°C). Lag relationships, independent effects, and interactions were characterised by use of modified Poisson models and compared with and without adjustment for seasonality and between-site variation. Final models were created with stepwise selection of main effects and interactions and their validity assessed by excluding each site in turn and calculating Tjur’s Coefficients of Determination.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nAll nine hydrometeorological variables were significantly associated with rotavirus infection after adjusting for seasonality and between-site variation over multiple consecutive or non-consecutive lags, showing complex, often non-linear associations that differed by symptom status and showed considerable mutual interaction. The final models explained 5.9% to 6.2% of the variability in rotavirus infection in the pooled data and their predictions explained between 0.0% and 14.1% of the variability at individual study sites.\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\nThese results suggest that the effect of climate on rotavirus transmission was mediated by four independent mechanisms: waterborne dispersal, airborne dispersal, virus survival on soil and surfaces, and host factors. Earth observation data products available at a global scale and at subdaily resolution can be combined with longitudinal surveillance data to test hypotheses about routes and drivers of transmission but showed little potential for making predictions in this setting.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Health, Fogarty International Center; Sherrilyn and Ken Fisher Center for Environmental Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine; and NASA’s Group on Earth Observations Work Programme.\\n\\n# Correspondence\\n\\nDr. Margaret N Kosek, Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Rotavirus is the enteric pathogen for which associations with climate factors have been most thoroughly explored. Numerous studies and reviews have attempted to characterise associations between meteorological exposures and either general diarrhoeal disease or rotavirus-specific outcomes at particular locations, with several reporting relationships with temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. Associations with river levels, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation have also been documented.\\n\\nHypothesised explanations for these findings emphasise three possible pathways: survivability of the virus outside the host, dispersion of the virus through the environment, and host behavioural factors. However, several questions remain about the relative importance of these mechanisms.\\n\\n# Added Value of This Study\\n\\nThis study incorporates information from eight different epidemiological surveillance sites representing different climate locations. It is, to our knowledge, the first to combine multiple climate variables, single-day hydrometeorological exposure estimates, differential lag relationships, interactions, non-linearity, and adjustment for seasonality. It also assesses for the first time the validity of models based on climate data in predicting site-specific rotavirus disease burden.\\n\\n# Implications of All the Available Evidence\\n\\nNumerous hydrometeorological variables show complex, non-linear associations with rotavirus infection that differ by episode type and operate over different lag lengths, including as short a period as 2 days. Available evidence suggests that the effect of climate on rotavirus transmission is mediated by four independent mechanisms: waterborne dispersal, airborne dispersal, virus survival on soil and surfaces, and host factors. Changes in weather patterns might alter the rotavirus disease burden in different directions depending on the climate zone and whether the rotavirus vaccine has been introduced.\\n\\n# Hypothesised Pathways\\n\\nThe first is survival of the virus outside the host: atmospheric and soil conditions might affect the duration of survival of rotavirus when suspended in airborne fomites. The second is dispersal of the virus through the environment: rainfall runoff is a means by which viruses disseminate and collect in surface water or groundwater or are rinsed from the soil, while wind and pressure might promote their aerial transport. The third is host factors and behaviours: human responses to weather conditions might mediate or interact with climate exposures. For example, rainfall promotes contact between infected and susceptible individuals as they congregate indoors, and seasonal changes in diet or water sources alter exposure to pathogens.\\n\\n# Study Population\\n\\nThe Etiology Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) project was designed to investigate risk factors for enteric infection, diarrhoeal disease, and undernutrition. Birth cohorts of 227 to 303 newborn babies were recruited from communities in eight low-income and middle-income countries: Dhaka, Bangladesh; Fortaleza, Brazil; Vellore, India; Bhaktapur, Nepal; Naushero Feroze, Pakistan; Loreto, Peru; Venda, South Africa; and Haydom, Tanzania. Cohorts were monitored continuously over their first 2 years of life from November 2009 to March 2014 (the duration of follow-up differed by site).\\n\\nEthical approval for MAL-ED was given by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board as well as from the respective partner institutions at each site. Written consent was obtained from all participants’ caregivers.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Outcome Variables\\n\\nStool samples were collected from study participants at monthly intervals following enrolment and following reporting of a diarrhoeal episode by the child’s caregiver. Rotavirus infection status was ascertained by two methods. Samples from children who remained in the study for up to 24 months of age were tested for rotavirus (and other enteropathogens) with probe-based quantitative PCR assays on custom-developed TaqMan Array Cards (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA). Samples from participants who did not complete follow-up were assessed for rotavirus positivity by the ProSpecT ELISA diagnostic test (Oxoid, Ely, UK). Infection status was ascertained for more than 50,000 stool samples from 2100 study participants. Because the date of their collection was recorded, it was possible to match these results with daily meteorological exposure estimates from historical weather data re-analysis by precise date. Enrolment of participants was staggered throughout the calendar year to eliminate effects of age on seasonality, so the resulting data set constituted a continuous time series of rotavirus-positive and rotavirus-negative samples spanning the follow-up period.\\n\\n# Exposure Variables'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'doi': 'paper 10.1016/S2542-5196(19)30084-1 58'}, page_content='# Exposure Variables\\n\\nThe main exposure variables in this analysis were a set of historical daily EO-based and model-based re-analysis-derived estimates of hydrometeorological variables at each MAL-ED study site location drawn from version 2.1 of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). These data have been described, evaluated, made publicly available, and justified for use in cohort data analyses; their advantages and limitations have been discussed elsewhere. A script was run to extract all variable values from the gridded GLDAS files (which have a horizontal resolution of 0.25 decimal degrees) for the 2007–16 period at the coordinates of the eight MAL-ED site locations. The 3-hourly estimates were aggregated to daily averages, totals, or minimum and maximum daily values as appropriate. Nine variables were selected on the basis of their hypothesised potential to influence rotavirus transmission via two mechanisms, described below.\\n\\nThe first mechanism was virus dispersal. Waterborne virus dispersal was measured by the daily total precipitation volume (mm) and daily total surface runoff (mm). Airborne virus dispersal was measured by surface pressure (mbar) and wind speed (m/s).\\n\\nThe second mechanism was virus survival, which was measured by relative humidity (%), soil moisture (%), solar radiation (W/m²), specific humidity (kg/kg), and average daily temperatures (°C; calculated from the daily minimum and maximum).\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nThe probability of a stool sample being positive for rotavirus on a given day was calculated from risk ratios by fitting modified Poisson models with clustered robust variance estimation to the binary infection status outcome by use of generalised linear models. Two separate effects of the hydrometeorological exposure variables on the rotavirus outcome were modelled: the absolute effect and the adjusted effect.\\n\\nAbsolute effect analyses made no adjustment for seasonality and therefore incorporated the effect of medium-term, intra-annual variability due to shifts in both climate and rotavirus incidence over the yearly cycle. For adjusted effect analyses, the hydrometeorological variables were first standardised to their local distributions by recalculating each one as the deviation from its site-specific 10-year mean value (2007–16) to adjust for confounding by between-site variation or by sites that might be outliers with respect to both exposures and outcome. Then, the co-seasonality of rotavirus incidence (which has been shown to have two annual peaks at most sites) and meteorological conditions was adjusted for by including annual and biannual Fourier series sine and cosine functions with site-specific interactions in the model to account for up to two annual peaks. Rotavirus seasonality patterns differ by location so terms for the interaction between the sites and the annual and biannual harmonics were included, with main effect terms omitted.\\n\\nExposures that showed non-linear associations with rotavirus were modelled with restricted cubic spline terms with degrees of freedom ascertained by comparing the Akaike information criterion statistic from models using three to five knots positioned at the corresponding percentiles of the variable distribution. The following potentially confounding covariates were included in all models: vaccine category, age, and sample type.\\n\\nVaccine category was a binary variable comparing sites in countries that had introduced the rotavirus vaccine at the time of data collection (Fortaleza, Brazil; Loreto, Peru; and Venda, South Africa) to those that had not (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Vellore, India; Bhaktapur, Nepal; Naushero Feroze, Pakistan; and Haydom, Tanzania) to adjust for the vaccine-related reductions in background transmission levels. Participants’ ages (in continuous months) at the time of sample collection were represented in the model by use of linear, quadratic, and cubic terms with vaccine category-specific interaction terms to account for observed differences in the relationship between age and rotavirus transmission in the two groups of sites. Sample type was a binary variable representing whether the sample was a diarrhoeal or monthly surveillance stool included to separately model symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus episodes.\\n\\nLag lengths for each variable and effect were selected according to criteria outlined in the appendix and included with covariates in separate, single-variable models to establish their independent associations with rotavirus. Interactions between these main exposures and stool sample type were included if they were significant at the alpha level of 0.05 since some.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.appendix {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nInteractions might differentially affect the probability of inducing symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infections. Probabilities predicted by these single-variable models were plotted across the range of values for each variable, effect, and symptom status. Backward stepwise selection was used to identify variables that retained significance at the alpha level of 0.05 in the presence of the others for each effect. Specific humidity was excluded from all multivariable models because it is almost entirely a function of temperature and relative humidity, and only the results of its independent association are reported.\\n\\nHaving selected a model of main effects, forward stepwise selection was used on all possible interactions between retained hydrometeorological variables with each other, by use of multiplicative pairwise combinations of terms, and with vaccine category and sample type with an alpha threshold of 0.01 or lower for inclusion in a final interaction model. Variables that lost significance in the presence of retained interaction terms for other variables were excluded from the final models.\\n\\nThe combined significance of the terms for each covariate—the spline, polynomial, and Fourier series terms and their interactions—were each assessed with the Wald test. To quantify the proportion of the variance explained by the final models and by the meteorological variables and their interactions, full and partial Tjur’s Coefficients of Determination (CODs) were calculated from the final models compared with null models that included only the non-hydrometeorological covariates.\\n\\nThe validity of the ability of the two final interaction models to make predictions based on out-of-sample data was assessed by excluding each site in turn, fitting the models to data from the remaining seven sites, then calculating CODs for the excluded site. Analyses were carried out with Stata, version 15.\\n\\n# Role of the Funding Source\\n\\nThe funders had no role in study design, study implementation, data analysis, or interpretation of the results.

For all sites, both vaccine categories and overall, the percentage of rotavirus-positive samples was higher in diarrhoeal than in monthly stools. For both sample types, the proportion of rotavirus-positive stools was lower for sites in countries where the vaccine had been introduced. However, rotavirus incidence in the Peru site was higher than at several sites that had not yet introduced the vaccine. Additionally, the incidence of diarrhoeal rotavirus in the site in Tanzania, which had not introduced the vaccine, was notably low.

The appendix also shows equivalent smooth plots for the day of the year on which the sample was collected. Rotavirus transmission was highly seasonal except in the low-transmission Brazil site. The south Asian sites had sharp, primary peaks in the drier period at the turn of the year and a smaller peak in the mid-year monsoon season, while the remaining southern hemisphere sites had mid-year primary peaks and, with the exception of the Peru site, secondary peaks during the wetter part of the year.\\n\\nThe results of the lag analysis are described in the appendix and described here. Figure 2 plots the probabilities of rotavirus infection predicted by the single-variable absolute effect models by symptom status over the selected lag lengths. The absolute effect of precipitation on rotavirus probability was linear and low in magnitude and significance. Relative humidity and soil moisture both had effects that were significant and similar in magnitude and shape; the direct effect was negligible for asymptomatic infections, but for symptomatic episodes it showed low probability at the bottom extreme of the distribution rising to a plateau in the top tercile. Solar radiation showed a significant inverse association with rotavirus above a value of approximately 190 W/m², most markedly for diarrhoeal episodes. Increasing specific humidity showed no significant effect.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Incidence\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Incidence\\n\\n# Table 1: Number of Study Participants and Rotavirus Incidence\\n\\n|Location|Rotavirus-positive samples (n, %)|Total samples|Rotavirus incidence per 100 person-years|Follow-up time (person-years)|Total participants|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Fortaleza, Brazil|38 (1.0%)|3624|10.2|371.7|227|\\n|Loreto, Peru|178 (2.8%)|6328|36.9|482.7|303|\\n|Venda, South Africa|104 (1.8%)|5764|20.6|505.3|290|\\n|Total (Vaccine introduced)|320 (2.0%)|15716|23.5|1359.7|820|\\n|Dhaka, Bangladesh|264 (5.0%)|5282|57.7|457.6|265|\\n|Vellore, India|374 (6.7%)|5570|80.8|462.6|243|\\n|Bhaktapur, Nepal|163 (3.0%)|5519|35.2|462.6|238|\\n|Naushero Feroze, Pakistan|172 (3.0%)|5676|33.3|516.3|275|\\n|Haydom, Tanzania|239 (4.6%)|5147|51.2|467.0|259|\\n|Total (Vaccine not yet introduced)|1212 (4.5%)|27194|51.2|2366.0|1280|\\n\\n# Figure 1: Hydrometeorological Variables at MAL-ED Sites\\n\\nBox plots of the distributions of the nine hydrometeorological variables at the eight MAL-ED sites.\\n\\nGlobal Land Data Assimilation System data are disseminated as part of the mission of NASA’s Earth Science Division and archived and distributed by the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center.\\n\\nThere is a discernible trend in asymptomatic rotavirus infection, but for symptomatic episodes, a threshold effect was observed with a marked direct association in the upper quartile.

Differences in effect between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were also assessed. Many hydrometeorological variables—including several not commonly measured by weather stations—showed complex, non-linear associations with rotavirus infection that differed by episode type and were independently and significantly associated across multiple consecutive or non-consecutive lags, including as short a period as 2 days.\\n\\nThe results show that the effect of climate on rotavirus transmission is being mediated by four independent mechanisms: waterborne dispersal, airborne dispersal, survival on soil and surfaces, and host factors.\\n\\nWith regard to waterborne dispersal, it is thought that precipitation drives enteric pathogen transmission via different mechanisms at the two extremes, with heavy rainfall and runoff flushing microorganisms from soils and surfaces into water sources and drought conditions concentrating them in these environments. The U-shaped association between precipitation and rotavirus infection predicted by the adjusted effect model, with lowest probability at the site-specific average, supports this hypothesis.\\n\\nFurthermore, the absence of an interaction effect in the final absolute effect model might be due to competing pathways influencing rotavirus transmission in opposite directions during different seasons. Recent studies have found that these opposing effects are a notable feature of rotavirus epidemiology, particularly in Southeast Asia.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Transmission\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis paper explores the complex interactions between various hydrometeorological variables and the transmission of rotavirus, highlighting the role of aerosol dynamics and environmental conditions.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus transmission has long been suspected to occur via an airborne route, with hypothesized vehicles including dried dust and liquid particles.

To reduce the incidence, a thorough understanding of the epidemiology of infection is needed. This retrospective analysis of 36,000 notified human cases during a high-risk period between 2001 and 2007 explored the spatial and temporal determinants of Campylobacter notifications at a fine spatial scale in order to improve understanding of the complex epidemiology. Social deprivation was associated with a decreased risk of notification, whereas urban residence was associated with an increased risk. However, for young children, rural residence was a risk factor. High dairy cattle density was associated with an increased risk of notification in two of the three regions investigated. Campylobacter notification patterns exhibit large temporal variations; however, few factors were associated with periods of increased risk, in particular, temperature did not appear to drive the seasonality in campylobacteriosis.\\n\\nKey words: Campylobacter, infectious disease epidemiology, notifiable infectious diseases, spatial modelling, zoonotic foodborne diseases.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis is New Zealand’s most commonly reported notifiable infectious disease [1], a situation that is repeated in many other countries [2]. The many possible transmission routes from Campylobacter reservoirs to humans have made precise quantitative investigations into its complex epidemiology difficult [3–8]. This situation may suggest that localized risk factors strongly influence Campylobacter transmission.\\n\\nIn addition, the number of cases varies significantly throughout the year with much higher case rates during the summer. The reasons for this seasonality are not known [9], although a number of potential drivers have been proposed including: increased shedding in animal reservoirs and higher levels of contamination in the food chain [10–13], changes in human behaviour [14], and the abundance of invertebrate vectors [15, 16]. A greater understanding of the seasonal drivers for infection may help to shed more light on the epidemiological pathways. This leads us to study temporal as well as spatial patterns.\\n\\nThere are several risk factors that are known to be associated with Campylobacter notifications, and...\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: Dr S.

Social deprivation is a known risk factor for various infectious diseases; however, a UK study indicated that campylobacteriosis notifications are higher among individuals with higher socioeconomic status [17], suggesting that social deprivation may act as a protective factor. Alternatively, social deprivation may influence the willingness to access healthcare, affecting the proportion of cases that are reported.\\n\\nGender is also a significant risk factor for campylobacteriosis, with males generally exhibiting higher notification rates than females [18, 19]. Data from 2001–2004 showed significantly higher rates of notification and hospitalization in urban populations compared to rural populations. However, when analyzing children and adults separately, children under 15 years in rural areas were reported at significantly higher rates than their urban counterparts. A recent Scottish study corroborated these findings, showing higher notification rates in rural children [20].\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis case rates are highly seasonal, with considerable variation between years regarding the timing, duration, and magnitude of peak incidence. Baker et al. [19] found that the highest rates occurred during the summer months, although increased notifications during early winter have also been observed in New Zealand, particularly during the winter of 2006 when a national epidemic occurred [22]. Most cases in New Zealand are considered sporadic [23], although brief localized outbreaks do occur [24].\\n\\nSeveral studies have analyzed the relationship between weather and campylobacteriosis case rates, particularly concerning the underlying causes of seasonality [9, 25, 26]. It is evident from the literature that spatial location influences how weather relates to notifications, as different epidemiological pathways may be more prominent in various locations, each affected differently by weather conditions. Ambient temperature is often suggested to influence infection rates [9, 25, 27].\\n\\nAs campylobacteriosis is a notifiable disease in New Zealand, extensive information is routinely collected from reported cases by public health services, including home addresses. This data is entered into a centralized database called EpiSurv, managed by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR). Summary statistics from this large dataset are carefully monitored, with spatial analysis routinely published at the district health board (DHB) level. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal epidemiology of campylobacteriosis at a much greater spatial resolution, utilizing three regions of New Zealand with diverse geography and climate: Auckland (urban), Canterbury (mixed), and Manawatu (rural).\\n\\nThe New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) established the Manawatu region as a ‘sentinel surveillance site’ for campylobacteriosis in its 2005 Campylobacter strategy [5, 6]. This initiative aimed to combine molecular epidemiology and intensive surveillance to uncover the reservoirs behind the majority of notified cases and to measure the effectiveness of control measures in the poultry industry implemented between 2005 and 2008. Consequently, there are extremely high completion rates for the epidemiological information in the Manawatu region, enhancing the analysis of additional covariate information about the cases, such as gender and age group.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThis work examines notification data from three regions of New Zealand, each with slightly different geography and climate: Auckland, Canterbury, and Manawatu. The spatial location of a notification is recorded at the meshblock level, which is the smallest region defined for the New Zealand census, containing between zero and approximately 200 individuals.\\n---\\n# Space–time determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Space–time determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\n# Table 1.

The urban/rural status of the meshblocks is classified according to the seven grades of rurality given by Statistics New Zealand. For this study, the four most rural grades (up to ‘Rural with high urban influence’) were classed as rural and the remaining three grades (from ‘Independent urban areas’) were classed as urban.\\n\\nThe Auckland, Canterbury, and Manawatu regions are made up of 9709, 4313, and 1834 meshblocks, respectively, and have usually resident populations (obtained from the 2006 New Zealand census) of 1,310,529, 466,344, and 158,808, respectively, representing 48% of the country’s population. The notification data came from the 6-year period 2001–2006 for Auckland and Canterbury and the 7-year period 2001–2007 for Manawatu. This period was studied because nationally there was a steady increase in notifications which peaked in 2006. Some cases had to be omitted from the study as the residential address in the database did not give rise to an accurate spatial location (see Table 1). For cases in the Manawatu region, we obtained additional epidemiological data from the EpiSurv database, including gender, age group, occupation, and information concerning exposure to some specific risk factors.\\n\\nIn New Zealand, all primary-care consultations are partially funded by DHBs with most patients paying an additional co-payment, especially for ‘out-of-hours’ attendances. Microbiological investigations in primary care are fully funded. In 2005–2007, for each notified case of acute gastrointestinal illness in New Zealand, there were an estimated 222 cases in the community, of which about 49 visited a general practitioner (GP).\\n\\nThe covariate data for potential risk factors included the Social Deprivation Index (SDI), weather information, proximity to large poultry farms, and livestock densities. The SDI was calculated at the meshblock level from the 2006 census and proved to be a key risk factor in urban areas. In rural areas, proximity to high livestock densities such as dairy cattle was also a risk factor. Data on farm locations and sizes was taken from the AgriBase database (a product of AsureQuality, New Zealand) from January 2006. Weather data from weather stations throughout each region were taken from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), such as hours of sunshine, maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall, and stormwater run-off. There were 16 weather stations used for Manawatu, 46 for Auckland, and 33 for Canterbury, although not all of these have readings available for all variables considered. All spatial and temporal data were interpolated or aggregated to the meshblock and week level to facilitate comparison with the notification data.\\n\\n# Spatial and temporal distributions\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis notification data displays both large spatial variation and complex temporal patterns. In summer, there is an increase in notifications; however, the size, duration, and timing of this peak vary from year to year. There can also be winter epidemics, like the one observed in 2006, and sharp localized spikes in notifications with a shared exposure. In the present study, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used in an attempt to capture these spatial and temporal variations in infection risk and overcome some of the difficulties inherent in modelling such complex datasets.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\n# Statistical Model\\n\\nThe number of notified cases of campylobacteriosis Yi,t in meshblock i and week t is assumed to have a Poisson distribution with mean Nili,t, where Ni is the usually resident population of meshblock i and li,t represents the expected risk at this point in time and space. A Poisson distribution was used rather than a negative binomial due to the fine spatial scale – there were not enough observations with multiple cases to accurately estimate an overdispersion parameter.\\n\\nNext, we separated the risk into its spatial and temporal components through the relation log(li,t) = Rt + Ui, where Rt and Ui are the purely temporal and purely spatial components of the risk respectively, so that the expected number of cases in meshblock i and week t is given by Ni exp(Rt + Ui). For the spatial component, a Gaussian Markov Random field prior is assumed, in which the risk in each meshblock is assumed to be similar to the mean risk of the neighbouring meshblocks.\\n\\nMore formally, we assumed the following full conditional distribution:\\n\\nUi ~ N(Σj∈n(i) Uj, kU), where n(i) is the set of indices of meshblocks neighbouring meshblock i.\\n\\nFor the temporal component, we assumed a Gaussian second-order random walk prior. This assumes that the change in risk from week t to week t+1 will be similar to the change in risk from week t-1 to week t.\\n\\nWe assumed flat priors for R1 and R2 so that the temporal component can absorb the baseline level of risk. For the hyperparameters kR and kU, we assumed conjugate gamma-distributed priors. For more information about the prior specifications and the implementation of an MCMC algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution, see the Appendix.\\n\\n# Social Deprivation\\n\\nIn order to assess any associations between social deprivation and campylobacteriosis notifications, we first compared maps of the estimated spatial component with maps of social deprivation, given by the Social Deprivation Index (SDI). The SDI is an area-based measure of deprivation derived from variables in the five-yearly New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings. It is calculated at the meshblock level and the scores are grouped into deciles taking integer values between 1 (least deprived) and 10 (most deprived).\\n\\nThe observed associations between SDI and notifications can then be quantified by modifying the model described in the ‘Spatial and temporal distributions’ section. Because the spatial component and the SDI are so highly correlated, models which include both appear not to be identifiable. We therefore removed the spatial component from the model and replaced it with a fixed effect for each of the 10 levels of deprivation.\\n\\nThe linear predictor becomes log(li,t) = Rt + VD(i), where D(i) is the social deprivation index decile score of meshblock i. For the fixed effects V1, …, V10, we assumed a Gaussian first-order random walk prior as we believed the risk for one level of SDI will be similar to the risk for adjacent values of SDI.\\n\\nMore precisely, given V1, …, Vj, Vj+1 ~ N(Vj, kV) with a gamma-distributed hyperprior kV ~ Gamma(1, 10-4). This model allows nonlinear trends in the association between SDI and notification risk to be visible in the posterior distribution.\\n\\n# Livestock Density\\n\\nIn rural areas, the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis is different from urban areas, and one reason for this might be that environmental exposures, e.g., direct contact with animals and their faeces, are more prominent routes of transmission. We investigated the association between animal density, SDI, and campylobacteriosis notifications in rural meshblocks for the following stock types: poultry, dairy cattle, beef cattle, and sheep.\\n\\nFrom the AgriBase database, we extracted the number of each stock type for each farm and a map of the land each farm occupies. By overlaying the meshblock boundaries on this map and assuming that the animals were evenly spaced throughout each farm, we estimated the number of animals in each meshblock. We then divided the number of animals in each meshblock by the meshblock area to produce an estimate of the density of each stock type, in animals per hectare.'),\n",

We then divided the number of animals in each meshblock by the meshblock area to produce an estimate of the density of each stock type, in animals per hectare.\\n\\nIn addition, we crudely estimated the proximity of a meshblock to a large poultry farm (>1000 birds), by the connectedness of each meshblock to a meshblock containing a poultry farm.\\n---\\n# Space–time determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Space–time determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\nContaining large poultry farms were given distance zero, and their neighbours distance 1, and so on. This measure of distance was preferred to Euclidean distance to the meshblock centroid because in rural areas some of the meshblocks are very large, and so part of the meshblock could be very close to a farm; however, the distance to the centroid would still be large. All of these variables are spatially varying and assumed to be approximately constant for the duration of the study.\\n\\nWe wished to uncover which of these variables influenced the spatial variations in notification risk. Therefore rather than fitting a spatial model like the one described in the ‘Spatial and temporal distributions’ section, a multiple Poisson regression model with log link function was fitted using the generalized linear model function (fitglm) in R version 2.5.1 (R Development Core Team, Austria). The number of cases in each rural meshblock was taken as the response variable, the population in the meshblock was used as an offset and the variables SDI, poultry farm distance and the animal density variables were used as predictors. A backward stepwise regression procedure was then followed to eliminate variables with a P value >0.15. Since only rural areas were used in this analysis, the number of meshblocks is reduced to 519 for Manawatu, 785 for Canterbury and 567 for Auckland.\\n\\n# Age and Gender\\n\\nFor the Manawatu region we extracted some additional information about the notifications from the EpiSurv database, including the gender and age group of each case. Denominator information for these variables was obtained from the 2006 census. The spatial distributions of each age group and gender were explored using the Bayesian hierarchical model described in the ‘Spatial and temporal distributions’ section. Some age groups experienced very few cases and the sparseness of the data caused problems with the convergence of the MCMC. In order to overcome this, some of the age categories were pooled; a more informative prior for the hyperparameter was used [kUyGamma(1.5, 015)] and the Markov chains were run for longer.\\n\\n# Weather\\n\\nTo investigate the drivers of the seasonal variation in notifications, we took a less sophisticated and more direct approach than elsewhere in the literature by jointly plotting the time-series of reported cases and the weather data. This enabled us to visually compare any periodic patterns in both of the time-series. This method has the advantage that none of the information in a complex trend is lost through the use of summary statistics, e.g. the time of peak notifications.\\n\\nThe weather data consisted of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, water run-off and hours of sunshine. These data were taken from as many weather stations as possible spread throughout (and just outside) each of the regions being investigated. The spatial dimension was removed by taking the mean over all of the weather stations that recorded observations for a day. These daily means were then averaged to provide a weekly mean. In order to make the weather datasets easier to compare to the weekly case-series, we first centred both series by subtracting the mean and normalized them by dividing by the standard deviation. Finally, we applied some simple smoothing by replacing the observation at time t with the mean of any observations between t-3 and t+3.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Spatial and Temporal Distributions\\n\\nFigure 1: Relative risks generated by the spatial component of the model for each of the three regions.\\n\\nIn the Manawatu region most rural areas had a lower risk of notification with the exception of the town of Foxton (population 4446) and the area surrounding the town of Sanson (population 492). There was a large variation in risk in the largest settlement in the region, the city of Palmerston North (population 67,000). The Canterbury and Auckland regions also showed surprisingly sharp changes in risk over small distances in their main centres. The white circle enclosing a part of Christchurch central business district had an extremely high rate of notifications. Of the three regions, Canterbury showed the greatest spatial variation in risk with several high-risk areas outside Christchurch. South Auckland contained a very low-risk area containing a large number of meshblocks. In the Auckland region many of the high-risk meshblocks were located on the coast.\\n\\nFigure 2: Expected number of campylobacteriosis notifications per 1000 people per week for each of the regions.\\n\\nThere were large changes in the number of cases predicted at different times of the year.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Notification\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nimg {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.data-graph {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Notification\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis paper presents an analysis of the estimated relative risk of campylobacteriosis notifications across different regions in New Zealand, specifically focusing on the Manawatu, Canterbury, and Auckland regions.\\n\\n# Relative Risk Analysis\\n\\nFig. 1.

Posterior relative campylobacteriosis notification risk for urban meshblocks against Social Deprivation Index (SDI). The shaded bands show 95% credible intervals.\\n\\nFigure 1 suggests that in urban areas the risk of notification was strongly related to the SDI. In rural areas, this pattern was not repeated – the associations with rural Campylobacter infections are explored in the next section. This, along with other evidence [5, 19, 20], suggests that there are large differences in the epidemiology of urban and rural campylobacteriosis notifications. In order to quantify the relationship between SDI and campylobacteriosis notifications in urban areas, we replaced the spatial component in the model with a fixed effect for each of the ten decile values of the SDI.\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the posterior mean relative risks for each decile value of SDI for all three regions, with the shaded bands indicating 95% credible intervals. There was decreased risk in deprived areas, particularly for indices 8, 9, and 10.

However, in the next age group (5–14 years), this trend is reversed with most of the cases occurring in urban Palmerston North. In all of the spatial distributions for older age groups (data not shown), the risk surfaces are much smoother (less varied) with greater risk of notification in urban areas.\\n\\nSignificantly more notifications are reported for males than females (P<0.0001 for χ² test).

There are some interesting anomalies that may have epidemiological explanations, e.g., occupational exposures associated with a poultry processing plant may be responsible for at least some of the increase in risk in the southwest of the Manawatu region. Moreover, the reduced risk of notification in very rural areas may be caused by reduced access to healthcare facilities, rather than a reduced number of cases. Features like these confirm that the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis is highly localized and reinforce the need for a fine-scale spatial analysis. Boundary effects and other spatial variations in reporting practices are a known drawback of such analyses, and there are several boundaries in the regions. The Auckland region is made up of three DHBs; however, there is one public health service for all three DHBs, and notifications are managed centrally. This may explain why there are no noticeable changes in risk across the boundaries. Although the Manawatu region consists of a single DHB, the very south of the map is investigated by a different public health service, which may explain the difference in notification risk.\\n---\\n# Space–time Determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n.relative-risk {\\ndisplay: flex;\\njustify-content: space-between;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.relative-risk div {\\nwidth: 45%;\\n}\\n\\n# Space–time Determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\n# Relative Risk (0- to 4-year-olds)\\n\\n- 0.73 – 0.75\\n- 0.76 – 0.85\\n- 0.86 – 0.95\\n- 0.96 – 1.05\\n- 1.06 – 1.15\\n- 1.16 – 1.25\\n- 1.26 – 2.78\\n\\n# Relative Risk (5- to 14-year-olds)\\n\\n- 0.61 – 0.75\\n- 0.76 – 0.85\\n- 0.86 – 0.95\\n- 0.96 – 1.05\\n- 1.06 – 1.15\\n- 1.16 – 1.25\\n- 1.26 – 2.21\\n\\nFig. 4.

Although many of their findings support known hypotheses and the fine-scale spatial analysis presented here (e.g., lower risk associated with social deprivation), their attempts to discuss the changes in the spatial distribution of notifications over time ignore any changes in the size and distribution of the underlying population. Specifically, New Zealand’s total population increased by 7.8% in the 5 years between the 2001 and 2006 censuses. Our study also assumes that the underlying population remains relatively constant during the study period, and for this reason, we have avoided any discussion of the determinants of overall temporal and spatio-temporal trends in case notification rates.\\n\\nThe graph of the posterior mean of the temporal component reveals some interesting patterns. The summer peaks can be seen to be irregular in height, duration, and timing. Canterbury has the most seasonal variation with severe but short epidemics in the summer. Auckland, being the most northerly region, has longer summer seasons and shorter winters, with notifications appearing to come in short bursts during the summer. The Manawatu region has a much lower notification rate than the other two regions. There is also an increase in the number of winter cases over time in all regions, culminating in the winter epidemic of 2006 and eclipsing the peak observed in 2003. A winter peak was not observed in a UK study where a spectral analysis revealed that the second most significant oscillation (after the annual cycle) had a 4-month period. The larger variation between summer and winter notification rates observed in Canterbury may be due to its climate, experiencing larger temperature variations than the other regions during the time period under investigation. This finding agrees with the study of Kovats et al., which found different seasonal patterns in New Zealand’s North and South Islands.\\n\\n# Social Deprivation\\n\\nOnly a small minority of Campylobacter infections present for medical attention and become notified. In the UK, for example, a large population-based study found there were 7.6 cases of laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter infection in the community for every case recorded by the disease surveillance system. Consequently, cultural, behavioural, and healthcare access factors can have a great impact on the observed pattern of disease incidence and distribution.

In New Zealand, children aged <6 years may not be charged a fee for visiting a GP (the main route of notification), while adults and older children typically incur a fee, potentially deterring lower-income individuals from seeking medical attention. Bessel et al. [20] found significant discrepancies in reporting rates among health boards in Scotland, indicating that notification rates can be heavily influenced by reporting practices.\\n\\nDifferences in food consumption patterns between high- and low-income groups may also play a role; for instance, low-income groups might consume less fresh and more frozen poultry, which has been linked to a lower risk of infection [40]. Additionally, higher-income individuals may have access to a wider variety of prepared foods. Rind & Pearce [36] found weak evidence suggesting that a high density of fresh food outlets could be a risk factor for campylobacteriosis in New Zealand, even after accounting for social deprivation.\\n\\nOne notable exception to the strong social deprivation index (SDI) relationship is observed in central Christchurch. In the area indicated by a white circle in the inset of Figure 1, a disproportionately high number of cases occur within a seemingly small population. Further investigation revealed that this anomaly is linked to the accuracy of address matching—specifically, how the residential address of a case is utilized to determine spatial location. Long streets crossing meshblock boundaries, combined with incorrect house number recording, can result in cases being misallocated to nearby meshblocks. However, the 'smoothing effect' of the Markov random field prior for the spatial component should help mitigate this artificial increase in risk. A summary of address-matching accuracy is provided in Table 1.\\n\\n# Livestock Density\\n\\nThe epidemiology of campylobacteriosis varies between urban and rural areas. In urban settings, the primary transmission route is believed to be through the consumption of contaminated food products [5, 6, 22], whereas in rural areas, environmental exposure is thought to play a more significant role in transmission [41]. Environmental exposures include direct contact with farm animals or their feces [42, 43], swimming in lakes and rivers, or drinking untreated water [14, 27, 44, 45]. Young children may be at increased risk from such exposures due to poorer hygiene [20], which could explain the notably higher infection rates in this age group.\\n\\nThe multiple regression model for rural notifications supports the hypothesis that environmental transmission routes contribute to the disease burden in Canterbury, where both sheep density and dairy cattle density are significant predictors of increased notification risk. In the Manawatu region, dairy cow density was identified as a significant risk factor. Conversely, beef cattle density did not show significance in any region, possibly due to differences in management practices and the level of direct human contact with fecal material from these animals [43]. In both the Manawatu and Canterbury regions, the distance to poultry farms was significant; however, the coefficient exhibited opposing signs in each region. This contradictory effect may stem from the limited number of meshblocks containing large poultry farms in each region (36 for Manawatu, 53 for Christchurch), alongside a spatial association in case rates that remains unexplained by the predictors. Neighboring meshblocks may share similar poultry farm distances and risks, leading to a spurious association.\\n\\n# Age and Gender\"),\n",

Due to exposure to a wider variety of strains, these children may develop increased resistance to re-infection and symptomatic illness in subsequent years compared to their urban counterparts [46]. This hypothesis may clarify why the spatial distribution of notifications in rural children under 5 years shows a higher risk in rural areas, while this trend reverses for those aged 5 to 14 years (see Fig. 4). In older age groups, the difference between urban and rural risk is smaller, yet urban areas still exhibit a higher overall risk (data not shown). It is possible that resistance to campylobacteriosis is sustained in rural populations through constant low-level exposure, which is absent in urban settings, or that any resistance in urban populations is overwhelmed by the introduction of unfamiliar strain types or brief periods of high exposure [46].\\n\\nIt is also crucial to note that the majority of New Zealand cases during the study period were likely caused by a single...\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #007BFF;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\n# Weather and Campylobacteriosis Notifications\\n\\nFigure 5 suggests that the peak in campylobacteriosis notifications occurs before the peak in temperature and hours of sunshine. Moreover, each phase of the cycle in the notifications appears to occur at the same time as, or prior to, the corresponding phase in the temperature and hours of sunshine. Such a relationship generates a high correlation between weather and notifications, but does not indicate a causal relationship. This finding may suggest that weather, and temperature in particular, is not the primary driver for seasonality in campylobacteriosis.\\n\\nUltimately, any seasonality in notifications is likely to be most strongly influenced by human behaviour, which could potentially be influenced purely by our expectations of the weather rather than the weather itself. Alternatively, it may be possible that the risk of exposure to infection is raised throughout the summer period but the risk of symptomatic illness reduces as the season progresses, due to an increase in immunity in the population. For example, the increased exposure may be attributable to seasonal changes in food preparation and cooking practices (such as barbequing) and other outdoor activities that increase exposure to animal faeces.\\n\\n# Possible Explanations for Seasonality\\n\\nThere are many other possible explanations for the seasonality in campylobacteriosis. Despite the known importance of poultry as a reservoir for Campylobacter spp., the peak in the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks has not been established to generate the peak in human notifications. Summer peaks have sometimes been observed in the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry and spring or early summer peaks are observed in notifications from a range of countries, with milder winters being associated with earlier peaks. It is likely that temperature does not directly cause either the peak in human notifications or poultry prevalence.\\n\\nInstead, each peak may be caused by a range of as yet unidentified factors which are related to climate. For example, some authors have suggested that the summer peak in poultry is caused by increases in fly populations and changes in management practices during the summer months. The increases in notifications observed in the winter and spring, particularly in rural areas, may be associated with increased contact with cattle during calving, which is highly seasonal in New Zealand and generally starts in late July.\\n\\n# Challenges in Inferring Risk Factors\\n\\nIt is challenging to attempt to infer short time-scale risk factors for infection from notification data. Typically, notification occurs several days after the onset of symptoms, which are thought to begin between 2 and 5 days after exposure. The median time lapse between the onset of symptoms and reporting was found to be 8 days. Variations in these delay lengths then obscure any causal relationships between the exposure and the notification. Clearly, it would be preferable to work with the date of onset rather than the date of notification; however, for the data used in this study, onset dates were rarely recorded.\\n\\nIn addition, the weather in New Zealand is highly variable and so weather information averaged over a week and averaged between the weather stations in the region is likely to lose any detailed information about how specific weather patterns influence human behaviour. Consequently, we have not included any detailed regression analysis using weather variables as predictors in this study.\\n\\n# Concluding Remarks\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis case rates are highly variable in both space and time, and the drivers for the observed seasonal trends in particular are poorly understood. Source attribution studies and other published evidence have implicated exposure to contaminated poultry as the dominant risk factor for infection in New Zealand over the study period. Nonetheless, by examining notification data, this study has provided additional evidence about other potential sources of infection.\\n\\nIn particular, this spatial analysis has highlighted the widely differing notification rates over short distances and confirmed that notification patterns are different in urban and rural areas. Social deprivation is strongly negatively associated with notification risk; however, it is unclear if this indicates a difference in infection rates, or if infections are much less likely to become notifications in deprived areas.\\n\\nIncreasingly sophisticated tools are being developed to identify the relationship between genotype and animal host and to assign human infections to individual sources. When considered alongside spatial and temporal epidemiological data, these provide considerable insight into the pathways for infection.\\n\\nReferences: [5–8, 19, 44, 47–51, 52–54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]\\n---\\n# Space–time Determinants of Campylobacter\\n\\n\\nHuman infection and inform the development and implementation of targeted control strategies.\\n\\n# Appendix\\n\\n# Implementation\\n\\nSamples from the posterior distribution were obtained using MCMC methods.

Lake8, Felipe J. Colón-González8, Sari Kovats9, Jan C. Semenza10, Trevor C. Bailey11, Anthony Kessel1,9, Lora E. Fleming11, and Gordon L. Nichols1,11,12\\n\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3840-7\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nBackground: Campylobacteriosis is a major public health concern. The weather factors that influence spatial and seasonal distributions are not fully understood.\\n\\nMethods: To investigate the impacts of temperature and rainfall on Campylobacter infections in England and Wales, cases of Campylobacter were linked to local temperature and rainfall at laboratory postcodes in the 30 days before the specimen date. Methods for investigation included a comparative conditional incidence, wavelet, clustering, and time series analyses.\\n\\nResults: The increase of Campylobacter infections in the late spring was significantly linked to temperature two weeks before, with an increase in conditional incidence of 0.175 cases per 100,000 per week for weeks 17 to 24; the relationship to temperature was not linear. Generalized structural time series model revealed that changes in temperature accounted for 33.3% of the expected cases of Campylobacteriosis, with an indication of the direction and relevant temperature range. Wavelet analysis showed a strong annual cycle with additional harmonics at four and six months. Cluster analysis showed three clusters of seasonality with geographic similarities representing metropolitan, rural, and other areas.\\n\\nConclusions: The association of Campylobacteriosis with temperature is likely to be indirect. High-resolution spatial temporal linkage of weather parameters and cases is important in improving weather associations with infectious diseases. The primary driver of Campylobacter incidence remains to be determined; other avenues, such as insect contamination of chicken flocks through poor biosecurity should be explored.\\n\\nKeywords: Campylobacter, Time series, Temperature, Rainfall, Climate change, Environmental health\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nThe distinctive seasonal pattern of Campylobacter incidence has suggested that seasonal changes in the environment contribute to this pattern. The examination of the numbers of Campylobacter in the small intestine and caeca of chicken over a 12-month period showed significant seasonal variation in the carriage rate which was associated with sunshine and temperature [1]. The analysis of surveillance data from Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand found a lack of clear and consistent association with rainfall, humidity, sunshine, and temperature [2]. The analysis of Campylobacter data from Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Finland, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales showed consistent seasonal patterns of infection with more cases in the summer, but with cases peaking at different times of the year [3]. Campylobacter rates in England and Wales were associated with temperature, sunshine, and rainfall, with temperature being the most significant variable and a 5% increase in Campylobacter cases was associated with a 1 °C rise in temperature to a maximum temperature of 14 °C [4–6]. An examination of the relationship between Campylobacter cases (along with Salmonella and pathogenic Escherichia coli) in Canada found an increase in cases of 2.2% for every degree of increase in temperature, with a low temperature threshold of 10 °C; another Canadian study...\\n\\n© The Author(s). 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

It highlights the inconsistencies in findings and the need for further research to understand the mechanisms behind these associations.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nDjennad et al. (2019) studied the association between Campylobacter incidence and temperature, finding a correlation with temperatures above 10 °C. In Massachusetts, Campylobacter incidence closely followed annual temperature peaks with a lag of 2–14 days, while a strong association was also noted in Georgia, US.\\n\\nThe impact of weather parameters on Campylobacter varied between temperate and sub-tropical areas of Australia. A spatial examination in New Zealand found no significant association with climate variables, indicating that temperature did not drive seasonality, nor was there a strong correlation with rainfall.\\n\\nJore et al. (2015) demonstrated a relationship between temperature, human infections, and chicken colonization across six European countries. Research in Switzerland suggested that the seasonality of Campylobacter is partly explained by chicken broiler contamination.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nWhile associations with weather and temperature are common in studies, the link is not as clear or direct as with Salmonella. Nichols (2017) and Ekdahl et al. (2018) proposed that flies could explain Campylobacter epidemiology through the transfer of contaminated materials from raw meats or feces to ready-to-eat foods, and/or through seasonal contamination of chicken flocks.\\n\\nOne complicating factor in Campylobacter transmission in developed countries is the significant percentage of cases related to foreign travel. Hartnack et al. (2018) emphasized the need to quantify Campylobacter transmission from broilers to humans and to include climatic factors for better epidemiological insights.\\n\\nSterk et al. (2019) analyzed the effect of climate change on Campylobacter runoff and human infection risks in the Netherlands, concluding that climate change has little overall impact on runoff from land to surface waters.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nCampylobacter surveillance data were extracted from the Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) database of Public Health England from 1989 to 2014. A case was defined as a human fecal sample that tested positive for Campylobacter. Most cases were laboratory-confirmed, primarily through selective culture media.\\n\\nMeteorological data were supplied by the Met Office and held on the Medical and Environmental Data Mash-up Infrastructure (MEDMI) platform. Reported cases between 2005 and 2009 were linked to local weather parameters, including maximum, minimum, and average daily temperatures, as well as daily rainfall in the 30 days preceding the specimen date.\\n\\n# Comparative Conditional Incidence\\n\\nGIS analysis was performed on cases with Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) using ArcGIS 10.2 for spatial analysis.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n[7] Djennad et al.

BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:255\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nA map of Campylobacter incidence between 2005 and 2009 from patient’s residential postcode data was produced. Some areas had poor residential postcode completeness resulting in areas with an apparent lower incidence. Comparative conditional incidence (CCI) is a new approach which uses cases and LSOA populations to examine differences between disease incidence at different temperature and rainfall in the 30 days before the specimen date within equal sized datasets.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nCCI is a sum of cases per week within all LSOAs with the same temperature divided by the sum of the population in the same LSOAs. It is conditional as the weather variables were available for the weeks and LSOAs where there were positive cases and excluded patients without a residential postcode as it was not possible to establish the LSOA.\\n\\n# Cluster Analysis\\n\\nWe examined the geographic similarity of Campylobacter seasonality in England and Wales in thirty-three sub-regional areas between 1989 and 2009. The fitted seasonality of Campylobacter infections across thirty-three Strategic Health Authorities were plotted in a dendrogram using hierarchical clustering analysis with Ward’s minimum variance.\\n\\n# Wavelet Analysis\\n\\nTo detect potential time-varying seasonality in Campylobacter that might result from Salmonella control measures in chicken production, we used wavelet analysis. Campylobacter daily counts between 1989 and 2009 were adjusted from the day of the year using a seven-day moving average and systematic adjustments for the reduced reporting over bank holidays and for long-term trends as previously reported.\\n\\n# Generalized Structural Time Series Model\\n\\nCampylobacter cases across ten geographical regions in England and Wales were examined using the generalized structural time series model (GEST) with a negative binomial distribution, where the natural logarithm of the expected cases of Campylobacter was decomposed into baseline, trend, and seasonal components.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nIncidence was determined from patient residence postcode data (2005–2014) and plotted by LSOA across England and Wales. The geographic representation of cases per 100,000 per week showed areas of the country with an apparently low incidence; this is presumed to be where residential postcode data were missing.\\n\\n# Table 1: Methods, Time, Geography, and Reason for Choice in the Analyses\\n\\n|Methods|Time|Spatial Unit|Reason for Choice|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|GIS incidence mapping|2005–2014|Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)|Individual resident postcodes (required for mapping by population) were not available before 2005.|\\n|Local linkage of cases and weather|2005–2009|Laboratory postcode|Local linkage of cases and weather variables through the laboratory postcode was available from 2005 to 2009 in ten geographical regions.|\\n|Comparative conditional incidence|2005–2009|LSOAs|Lack of negative cases, positive cases were linked to weather variables from 2005 to 2009.|\\n|GEST model|2005–2009|Laboratory postcode|Local linkage of cases and weather data through the laboratory postcode was available from 2005 to 2009 in ten geographical regions.|\\n|Wavelet analysis|1989–2009|England and Wales|The cases were not linked to weather variables.

Using four-week periods, average temperatures two weeks before, and splitting the data for each time period into two equal halves by temperature demonstrated that the relationship between temperature and incidence in each time period differed, forming a cyclic loop.\\n\\nFigure 1d: Relationship between temperature and incidence.\\n\\nFor weeks 17 to 20 and 21 to 24, there was an increase in the CCI of 0.175 cases per 100,000 per week for each degree increase in the temperature two weeks before. A similar approach using average rainfall over the previous four weeks showed no consistent links with the CCI.\\n\\n# Wavelet Analysis\\n\\nWavelet analysis of Campylobacter cases showed strong annual periodicity with smaller semi-annual and four-monthly periodicities. The analysis for temperature showed a strong annual seasonality but was also dominated by semi-annual patterns. However, there were years where this component was absent in temperature but present in Campylobacter cases.\\n\\nFigure 3a: Wavelet analysis showing periodicities in Campylobacter cases.\\n\\n# Statistical Associations\\n\\nUsing GEST with single coefficients for temperature and rainfall, we found a statistically significant association between Campylobacter and temperature of two weeks before the case diagnosis. The relationship was positive, with a 0.73% increase in the mean number of Campylobacter cases for every degree increase in average weekly temperature.\\n\\nFor rainfall, there was a slightly significant negative association, with a 0.24% decrease in the mean number of Campylobacter cases for every millimeter increase in total rainfall one week before the specimen date.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOur findings provide clear evidence for an association between Campylobacter cases and average, maximum, and minimum temperatures of two weeks prior to diagnosis. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of these relationships.\\n\\nVariable\\nCoefficient\\nSignificance\\n\\nTemperature (°C)\\n0.73%\\nStatistically Significant\\n\\nRainfall (mm)\\n-0.24%\\nSlightly Significant\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n.additional-file {\\nfont-style: italic;\\ncolor: #2980b9;\\n}\\n\\n# Research on Campylobacter Cases in England and Wales\\n\\n# Wavelet Analysis\\n\\nFig. 3 Wavelet analysis for Campylobacter cases reported between 1989 and 2009 and for temperature and rainfall in England and Wales.\\n\\nWavelet power spectrum of the root transformed time-series of daily Campylobacter cases adjusted using a seven-day rolling mean, removal of bank holiday artefacts and adjusted for long term trend;\\nb Wavelet power spectrum of the root transformed time-series of daily temperature;\\nc of daily Rainfall.

Notably, a steep increase in diagnosed cases was observed between weeks 19 and 24, indicating a significant relationship with temperature during this period.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nThe Generalized Estimating Equation (GEST) model was employed to analyze over-dispersed counts of Campylobacter cases, allowing for the extraction of hidden trends and seasonality. The model utilized multilevel factors for temperature, separated into 13 four-week periods, to estimate the contribution of temperature to the annual burden of Campylobacter.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe analysis revealed that 33.3% of the annual burden of Campylobacter was attributable to temperature, compared to 7.7% using a single coefficient value. The study also highlighted geographical differences in the strength of seasonal patterns, with stronger seasonality observed in Wales and the North East compared to urban areas like London and Birmingham.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nWavelet analysis indicated that Campylobacter cases could be interpreted as the superimposition of three main harmonics of annual, semi-annual, and four-month periods. The study suggests that local factors, including demographic differences and varying exposure risks, may influence the occurrence of Campylobacter disease.\\n\\n# Limitations\\n\\nData limitations included the use of laboratory postcodes as a proxy for patient residence, which may affect the accuracy of linking cases to weather parameters. Additionally, the analysis was limited to cases only, excluding weeks without reported cases.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe findings underscore the importance of linking environmental data with health outcomes to better understand the incidence of Campylobacter.

Using a range of statistical methods, the study suggests that temperature and/or rainfall alone cannot explain the entire seasonal variation of Campylobacteriosis risk in England and Wales. Further research should investigate if the temporal dependency of the relationship between Campylobacter incidence and temperature on the week might be driven by other environmental variables, or perhaps by an intrinsic seasonality in the dynamics of the bacterial population in the environment or in the zoonotic reservoir or potential vectors such as flies.\\n\\n# Conclusions\\n\\nThe epidemiology of Campylobacter remains enigmatic and interventions have had limited success to date. It is therefore an important organism to study to elucidate methodologies that have power and utility in explaining infectious disease and climate change epidemiology for other infectious diseases in the future.\\n\\n# Authors’ Contributions\\n\\nAll authors were involved in the conception and design of the study and interpretation of the results.

We estimated the effect of temperature on the number of cases notified by week in Montreal, Canada, from 1 January 1990 to 26 March 2006, simultaneously with the effect of the numbers of cases notified in the preceding weeks. The current campylobacteriosis count (week 0) was modelled by negative binomial regression, with earlier weekly average temperatures and earlier counts as predictors. Secular trends were accounted for by cubic spline functions and seasonal variations by sine-cosine functions. Indicator variables identified weeks with fewer than 5 working days. In the final statistical model, a 1°C increase in temperature above 10°C during any of weeks −1 to −6 was associated with a 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3% to 1.3%) increase in the current count. For each additional notified case during any of weeks −1 to −5 or −9 to −12, the increase in the current count was approximately 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2% to 1.0%). Thus, earlier temperatures and earlier counts have independent effects, that of temperatures being the larger one. The temperature effect is too small to require short term public health planning. However, in Montreal, an increase in average temperature of the order of 4.5°C, forecast by some for 2055, could produce a 23% increase in incidence, resulting in about 4,000 excess cases per year.\\n\\nKeywords: Campylobacteriosis, Temperature, Time series, Climate change\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nConcerns about the potential health effects of global warming include increases in bacterial infections among animals and humans (Hunter 2003; McMichael et al. 2006; Watson et al. 2005). A rise in average ambient temperatures would be accompanied by a greater frequency of prolonged hot weather (McMichael et al. 2006; Watson et al. 2005). These changes could affect the occurrence of infectious diseases, for instance through the increased proliferation of some microbes and of their vectors, including flies (McMichael et al. 2006), or increased human migration (McMichael et al. 2006), including “environmental refugees” (Watson et al. 2005).\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis is an enteric infection transmitted mostly through meat contaminated at the time of slaughter, but also to a lesser extent from person to person (Heymann 2004). It displays marked seasonality, the incidence (number of new cases) in temperate countries being about twice as high in summer as in winter months. This suggests that ambient temperature affects the transmission of the infection, but the processes behind this temperature effect on campylobacteriosis incidence are not so clear as for enteric pathogens that grow well in meat.\\n\\n&copy; 2011 International Journal of Biometeorology\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacteriosis Incidence and Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis Incidence and Temperature\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the independent effects of ambient temperatures and previous case counts on the incidence of campylobacteriosis, while accounting for seasonal and secular trends.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIncreased contamination of water or meat is unlikely to explain the rise in campylobacteriosis cases. Possible mechanisms include:\\n\\n1. Transmission by flies to foodstuffs or utensils.\\n2. Food preparation practices in hot weather that allow pathogen survival or cross-contamination.\\n3. Person-to-person transmission due to poorer hygiene in warm weather activities.\\n\\nMany correlated phenomena in summer contribute to the increased incidence of campylobacteriosis. This study aims to isolate the effect of temperature on disease incidence.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nWe analyzed all laboratory-confirmed campylobacteriosis cases reported to the Montreal Public Health Department from January 1, 1990, to March 26, 2006.

First, previous work on the temperature data had shown that similar results were obtained using weekly averages of either the daily minima, means, or maxima. All the results presented are therefore based on weekly averages of daily mean temperatures.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nThe relationship between temperatures and campylobacteriosis counts is not linear: at low temperatures, counts do not increase as much with temperature as at higher temperatures. We used cubic splines (with 4 degrees of freedom) to model the shape of the relationship between the campylobacteriosis count on any given week (week 0) and weekly temperature for each of weeks -1 to -12. Visual inspection of the spline-smoothed relationships showed them to be very similar for all weeks between -1 and -12, and roughly linear but with a gentle slope until somewhere between 5 and 15°C and a steeper slope thereafter.\\n\\nSince temperature on week -2 was the most promising predictor, based on preliminary multivariate models using untransformed temperatures, we used week -2 to test various threshold values. A threshold at 10°C gave the strongest association with the expected count on negative binomial regression including the smoothing terms mentioned above. Therefore, we transformed the weekly temperatures so that all values up to 10°C were recoded as 10°C and values above 10°C were used untransformed.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nIn Figure 2, the bars show the number of weeks during the study period in which the campylobacteriosis count had a given value, from 0 notified cases to the maximum of 27.

An arrow between two variables indicates the presence and direction of an effect of one on the other; the absence of an arrow indicates the absence of effect. The dependent variable is the current weekly count of notified cases. We assume that earlier temperatures can affect this count either directly or through their effect on earlier counts.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOther seasonal and secular factors included in the causal model are assumed to have an effect on the three main variables, but there may remain other factors not included in the model. In this causal model, at least among the main variables, the direction of the effects is unambiguous: later case counts cannot affect earlier counts and counts cannot affect temperatures.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacteriosis Counts Analysis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Analysis of Weekly Campylobacteriosis Counts\\n\\nThe analysis of weekly campylobacteriosis counts indicates a distribution that suggests a negative binomial regression model due to the variance of the counts being double their mean.

This suggested that adding to the model earlier temperatures and earlier counts, which are higher in warm months, might improve the fit.\\n\\nWhen earlier temperatures and earlier counts up to week −16 were separately added to this initial model, the terms T−1 to T−6, C−1 to C−5, and C−9 to C−12 all had strong effects that were generally significant at P&lt;0.05. These sets of consecutive temperatures or counts will be referred to as “strata”. When all earlier temperatures were added together, only T−2 remained significant. Previous studies have found significant effects for various strata of earlier temperatures, from T−1 up to T−6, depending on the study (Bentham and Langford 2001; Fleury et al. 2006; Louis et al. 2005). Because of these observations, and because we had no a priori information that would justify focusing on T−2, we decided to treat the terms in stratum T−1 to T−6 as “lag-stratified distributed lags” in order to stabilize the estimates and improve their precision (Armstrong 2006).\\n\\nThat is, T−1 to T−6 together were replaced by their mean, under the assumption that they all have the same effect. (To quantify the effect of an increase lasting only 1 week in a stratum of n weeks, one takes the nth root of the IRR.

The IRRs represent the effect resulting from the temperature increasing by 1°C (over 10°C) for any single week in the temperature stratum, or from the weekly count increasing by 1 case for any single week in one of the count strata.\\n\\nModel A adds to the initial model only the one temperature stratum with a significant effect (T−1 to T−6), model B adds only the two count strata with significant effects (C−1 to C−5 and C−9 to C−12), and model C adds all three strata. Model A shows that an increase of 1°C above 10°C in any of weeks −1 to −6 increases the current count by 0.7% ([1.0074−1] ×100). Model B shows that one extra case in any of weeks −1 to −5 or −9 to −12 increases the current count by 0.5%. Model C shows that temperature and count effects are little changed when adjusted for each other, meaning in particular that earlier temperatures did not in fact exert their effect on the current count through their effect on the counts during intervening weeks, as the IRR for stratum T−1 to T−6 remains essentially unchanged whether or not stratum C−1 to C−5 is included in the model.\\n\\nThe pseudo R2 for the initial model (Table 1) was 0.071; those for models A, B and C were 0.073, 0.076 and 0.078, respectively (Table 2). The pseudo R2 shows, like the log-likelihood, that model C best fits the data, but if it is taken as an estimate of the proportion of variance explained, it also shows that about 92% of the variance ([1−0.078]×100) of weekly campylobacteriosis counts still remains to be explained, by factors not in the model. The mean residual for model C was −0.0010, not much changed from the initial model; however, the mean of summertime residuals has come down to 0.1110 and that of residuals for the rest of the year has moved up to −0.0058, confirming that temperature and count terms have improved the model’s accounting for the seasonality of the disease.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nA handful of studies has quantified the relationship between campylobacteriosis incidence and ambient temperatures.

It highlights the findings of various studies and presents a causal diagram illustrating the determinants of current campylobacteriosis counts.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nSeveral studies have examined the relationship between environmental factors and the incidence of campylobacteriosis. Notably, temperature has been identified as having the strongest effect among these factors (Naumova et al. 2007; Kovats et al. 2005). Other studies have utilized different time series regression methods, incorporating rainfall and humidity as predictors (Bentham and Langford 2001; Bi et al. 2008; Fleury et al. 2006; Louis et al. 2005; Tam et al. 2006).\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nOne study specifically analyzed the relationship between current campylobacteriosis counts and previous counts, alongside climate variables such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, in Adelaide and Brisbane. The study found several significant incidence rate ratios (IRRs), indicating varying effects of temperature over different time lags (Bi et al. 2008).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nOur results align with previous findings, but with a crucial distinction: our IRRs for earlier counts can be interpreted as measures of effect due to the control for trends using periodic and spline functions. The causal diagram (Figure 4) illustrates the relationships between current counts and earlier counts and temperatures.\\n\\nFigure 4: Causal diagram of the determinants of the current campylobacteriosis count, based on the study results (model C). Each arrow indicates the effect of one predictor on the current count.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe short-term effects observed in the previous month’s counts may not solely be due to autocorrelations, as accounted for in the model. Possible explanations include person-to-person transmission or simultaneous exposure to contaminated foodstuffs. The longer-term effects of counts from three months prior remain less clear, with chicken being a significant contributor to campylobacteriosis.\\n\\n# Limitations\\n\\nOne limitation of this study, as with similar research, is the reliance on laboratory-confirmed cases for diagnosis, which may not capture the full incidence of the disease. Additionally, the seasonality of infection may vary by age, which was not accounted for in our analysis due to the unit of analysis being weekly case counts.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis study contributes to the understanding of the environmental determinants of campylobacteriosis and highlights the complexity of transmission routes influenced by temperature and other factors.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis and Temperature Effects\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\ntext-align: justify;\\n}\\n.acknowledgements, .declaration, .references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis and Temperature Effects\\n\\nThe incubation period of campylobacteriosis, a common foodborne illness, is typically 2–5 days (Heymann 2004).

Thus, for many cases, the temperatures recorded for weeks T−1 and T−2 are after the disease was contracted and cannot be causally linked to its acquisition.\\n\\nThe effect of temperature changes for weeks −1 to −6 indicates an increase in the risk of campylobacteriosis by 0.8% for each 1°C rise in mean temperature above 10°C. This effect is smaller than estimates from previous studies, which reported increases ranging from 0.9% to 3.5% (Tam et al. 2006) and 1.4% to 2.5% (Fleury et al. 2006). However, our findings align with these studies, considering their broad confidence intervals. There is a consensus that temperature increases over the previous six weeks correlate with higher campylobacteriosis counts for the current week.\\n\\nIn the short term, the temperature effects are too minor to necessitate public health planning for additional cases following warm weather. However, projections suggest that the annual average temperature in Montreal could rise by up to 4.5°C by 2055 (Charron et al. 2004). If this occurs, and all other factors remain constant, we could anticipate a 23% increase in notified campylobacteriosis cases, translating to approximately 107 additional cases annually in Montreal. Given that only about 1 in 38 cases are reported (Mead et al. 1999), the true incidence could rise by about 4,082 cases per year.\\n\\nIn the United States, approximately 2.4 million individuals are affected by campylobacteriosis annually, resulting in 13,000 hospitalizations and 125 deaths (Mead et al. 1999). If the temperature-related incidence increase observed in Montreal were applicable in the U.S., it could lead to 552,000 excess cases, 2,990 additional hospitalizations, and 29 extra deaths. Nonetheless, even such significant effects would likely be minor compared to the broader health impacts of global warming (Hunter 2003).\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors thank Environment Canada for providing the temperature data, Marc-André Bois, Claude Tremblay, and François Tessier for their assistance with data files, and Danielle Ramsay for information on chicken meat production.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the association between the occurrence of human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis and the ambient temperature.\\n\\nThe number of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cases in two German metropolises, Munich and Berlin, and three rural regions was analysed with simultaneous consideration of the ambient temperature over a period of four years (2001 to 2004) using regression, time series, and cross-correlation analysis. The statistical analysis showed that an increase in the ambient temperature correlated positively with an increase in human Salmonella and Campylobacter cases. The correlation occurred with a delay of approximately five weeks. The seasonal rise in ambient temperature correlated with increased incidence of bacterial diarrheal infections.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nSalmonella spp. and thermophilic Campylobacter spp. are the most important causes of human bacterial diarrheal infections in Europe and worldwide. In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported approximately 215,000 cases of human campylobacteriosis and 85,000 cases of human salmonellosis in Europe. At the species level, Campylobacter (C.) jejuni subsp. jejuni, followed by C. coli, are most commonly associated with human diseases. The Salmonella serotypes, Salmonella (S.) serotype Enteritidis and S. ser. Typhimurium, are the most frequently isolated in cases of human salmonellosis.\\n\\nSeasonality as a defining impact on incidence has been considered for human salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis as well as for other foodborne pathogens, emphasizing the public health importance of seasonal outbreak patterns. However, the studies do not show unambiguously seasonality, as geographical, climatic or production related factors can lead to different results. The seasonality of campylobacteriosis, if present, correlates to seasonality of Campylobacter colonisation in commercial broiler flocks. For Salmonella, the correlation between the occurrence of salmonellosis in humans and seasons is often explained by barbecuing or gardening, not by the contamination of chickens, but also shedding by other farm animal species like pigs and cattle must be taken into account.\\n\\nExcept of one study on Campylobacter time trend in broiler and humans, the association between the occurrence of human cases and temperature has not been studied in Germany. The hypothesis of our study was that there is an association between the occurrence of human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis and the ambient temperature. We therefore investigated data in municipal and rural German study sites. Specifically, we sought to identify the lag time, in weeks, for which the association between incidence and temperature was maximal. We therefore think that our study contributes to a better understanding of the association between the occurrence of clinical cases and the ambient temperature.\\n\\n1 Institute of Food Quality and Food Safety, University of Veterinary Medicine of Hannover Foundation, Bischofsholer Damm 15, D-30173 Hannover, Germany.\\n\\n2 Government of Lower Bavaria, Regierungsplatz 540, D-84028 Landshut, Germany.\\n\\n3 Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and University of Veterinary Medicine of Hannover Foundation, Max-Dohrn-Str 8-10, D-10589 Berlin, Germany.\\n\\n4 Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Veterinärstr. 2, D-85764 Oberschleissheim, Germany.\\n\\n*These authors contributed equally to the work.

Enteritidis (SE), S. Typhimurium (ST), Campylobacter (C.) jejuni (CJ) and C. coli (CC) cases reported in three areas (data obtained from Robert-Koch Institut, RKI, Germany) and average weekly temperature (data obtained from Germany’s Meteorological Service, DWD) in Germany 2001–2004.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nThe study was performed according to German law and has been approved by the competent committee of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover.\\n\\n# Prevalence of human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis\\n\\nInformation on the weekly frequency of human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cases was obtained from the reports of the Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) from 2001 to 2004 for metropolitan (Berlin, Munich) and rural study sites located in North-Swabian counties (Dillingen, Donau-Ries und Augsburg-Land). Eligible cases reported by the RKI had to meet at least one of the following criteria according to the German Infection Control Law of 2001:\\n\\n- clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmed\\n- clinical-epidemiologically confirmed\\n- clinically confirmed\\n\\nThe reporting period from the year 2001 onwards has been chosen, because a new reporting scheme was established in Germany in 2001 according to the Infection Control Law. This reporting scheme did not change through the whole reporting period, as well as no changes in the detection and reporting methods occurred. In the following, the incidences and case rates refer to the absolute counts of reported cases as described above.\\n\\n# Climate information\\n\\nTemperature measurements were obtained from Germany’s National Meteorological Service (DWD) for five locations: Berlin, Munich, Neuburg, Augsburg and Dillingen: from 2001 to 2004 (1461 days in total). DWD calculates the temperature average for every day from 24 temperature values, which are measured every hour. In situations where more than three temperature values were missed in a single day, the temperature average is calculated from the four values collected as 00, 06, 12, 18 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The reference time for one day starts normally at 23.51 UTC of the day before and ends at 23.50 UTC of the same day. Observation dates were related to the global used time in Greenwich (Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or UTC). The fixed date of observation is always 10 minutes before the reference point and the measurement is performed two meters above ground. The daily mean temperature data were aggregated to determine mean and maximum weekly temperatures, resulting in results for 212 weeks covering the study period. Geographical variability was expressed using the between-location standard deviation (SD) of mean temperatures for each of the 212 weeks. Likewise, between-location SD was established for 212 weekly maximum temperatures.\\n\\n# Statistical methods\\n\\nThe total reported cases per week of S. Enteritidis (SE), S. Typhimurium (ST), Campylobacter (C.) jejuni (CJ) and C. coli (CC), as well as the mean and maximum weekly temperature, were plotted as smoothed time series using the open source software package, R (command smoothed.spline with a smoothing parameter of 0.4 in the R statistical programme). Lag time was investigated between recorded temperature (weekly mean and maximum values) and reported cases using cross correlation analysis (R command ccf) yielding a time-series cross-correlation coefficient (CCC). To remove any possible trend effect, this analysis uses detrended and z-transformed case data. Briefly, we fitted generalized linear models with log-link and negative binomial errors and a continuous time variable as predictor for the analysis.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Human Diarrheal Infection'),\n",

Cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) analysis on human diarrheal infection. Weekly reported incidences of S. Enteritidis (SE), S. Typhimurium (ST), Campylobacter (C.) jejuni (CJ) and C. coli (CC) in three reporting areas were correlated with mean (left column) and maximum (right column) weekly temperature recordings in Germany 2001–2004.\\n\\n# Methodology\\n\\nWe analyzed the number of cases for each pathogen and study area and used the model residuals and observed mean number of cases for detrending the data. Lag time (in weeks) was identified for which a smoothed spline fitted to the observed CCC values became maximal.\\n\\nUsing the time lag in weeks that resulted in maximum correlation, the case rates were plotted against the mean and maximum temperature for the four-year lagged time series. To account for trend effects and to achieve comparability among pathogens with different incidence levels, the case rates were detrended and z-transformed.\\n\\nThe trends and the uncertainty were visualized using a smoothed regression spline and 95% confidence envelope based on a generalized additive model (“gam” method from mgcv package in R).\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nWe built a negative binomial regression model using a training data set obtained by randomly splitting the data set into two equal parts. Using the training data, we tested the effect of temperature at various lag periods and moving average, resulting in the choice of a lag-optimized temperature model.\\n\\nThis model uses the variable top, containing three-week moving average temperature at specific lag that provided the best fit according to Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) for each combination of location and bacterial species.\\n\\nWe included into the linear predictor also the bacterial agent (SE as reference compared to ST, CJ, and CC), the location (B as reference compared to M), the time in weeks as well as interaction terms between bacterial agent and all other predictors.\\n\\nAn alternative model has a similar form but used a common-lag temperature that provided the best fit (AIC) for all combinations of location and bacterial species. Case data reported from the rural locations were omitted from these models because they were composed of three smaller (geographically distinct) recruiting areas with small numbers of cases.\\n\\nSince R-square cannot be computed for negative binomial regression models, we used McFadden’s pseudo R-square as a surrogate estimate of the proportion of variance explained by the model.\\n\\n# Results and Discussion\\n\\nFirst, we asked whether the temperature recordings across the geographic locations varied widely. If the temperature variation was minimal, this would allow us to simplify the preliminary analysis using a single set of temperature values for all study sites.\\n\\nWe expressed the geographical variability of temperature using the between-location standard deviation (SD) of mean temperatures for each of the 212 weeks of the study. The between-location SD for all 212 weekly mean and maximum temperatures had a median (and 95th percentile) of 1.0 and 1.2 °C (2.1 and 2.4 °C), respectively, indicating only little temperature variation among the four locations.\\n\\nTherefore, we averaged the weekly mean and maximum temperatures values for the locations for the further analysis except for the final model.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Seasonal Incidences of Salmonella and Campylobacter\\n\\n#\\n# Seasonal Incidences of Salmonella and Campylobacter in Germany\\n\\nPublished in Scientific Reports\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the seasonal patterns of human cases of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE), Salmonella Typhimurium (ST), Campylobacter jejuni (CJ), and Campylobacter coli (CC) in three reporting areas in Germany from 2001 to 2004.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nUnderstanding the seasonal variations in the incidence of foodborne pathogens is crucial for public health.

Additional risk factors for Campylobacter infections include surface water, consumption of raw milk, and wild bird populations, which can contribute to the seasonality of human cases. Food producers should consider the impact of seasonality on their products’ safety characteristics. Unexpected seasonal patterns can occur, as evidenced by a study in Switzerland that detected a winter peak in human campylobacteriosis cases, unrelated to temperature, driven by a seasonal meat product.\\n\\nWhen using meteorological data, the validity of the data must be considered, whether derived from local weather stations or gridded estimates. Our study utilized reliable data from local weather stations. The choice between daily or weekly data versus aggregated monthly data is crucial, as more robust information can be obtained from shorter time intervals.\\n\\n# Limitations of the Study\\n\\nUnderreporting of campylobacteriosis cases is a significant limitation, as not all cases are presented to a physician, and microbiological analysis may fail to detect the pathogen. Additionally, demographic data for the study locations and time period are required for accurate incidence rates. Changes in the German population and food consumption patterns since the study period may also affect the results.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis study demonstrated that rising ambient temperatures are positively associated with an increase in the occurrence of S. Enteritidis, C. jejuni, and C. coli infections in Germany. The data suggest that public health authorities should consider increases in average ambient temperature as an early indicator for potential rises in foodborne infections, with a recommended increase in surveillance during this time.

Sources of human exposure include contaminated food and water, contact with animals and/or their faeces, and contact with infected individuals. The objectives of this study were to: (a) identify environmental conditions associated with the occurrence of Campylobacter in humans in four regions of Ontario, and (b) identify pooled measures of effect across all four regions and potential sources of heterogeneity.\\n\\nMethods: To address objective 1, human Campylobacter cases from four health regions of Ontario, Canada were analysed using negative binomial regression and case cross-over analysis to identify relationships between environmental factors (temperature, precipitation and hydrology of the local watershed) and the risk of human infection. To address objective 2, meta-analytic models were used to explore pooled measures of effect and when appropriate, meta-regression models were used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.\\n\\nResults: Human incidence exhibited strong seasonality with cases peaking in the late spring and summer. There was a decreasing yearly effect in three of the four health regions. A significant pooled effect was found for mean temperature after a 1-week lag (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02, 1.04). No significant pooled effects were found for precipitation or water flow. However, increased precipitation was associated with lower odds of campylobacteriosis in Wellington and York regions at 2- and 3-week lags, respectively, from the case cross-over analysis.\\n\\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that a climatic factor (specifically, mean temperature in the week prior) was associated with human case occurrence after a biologically plausible time period, but hydrologic factors are not.\\n\\nK E Y W O R D S: campylobacteriosis, case cross-over, environment, meta-analysis, seasonality\\n\\n# 1 | INTRODUCTION\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis is a bacterial enteric illness characterized by fever, abdominal pain, inflammation and diarrhoea with potential mucus or blood in the stool after a 2- to 5-day incubation period (Epps et al., 2013; Young, Davis, & Dirita, 2007). An uncommon, but severe, chronic sequelae of campylobacteriosis is Guillian Barré syndrome, a neurological syndrome that can lead to respiratory paralysis (Baker et al., 2012). Between 2007 and 2009, there were 10,916 reported cases of campylobacteriosis in Ontario resulting in a rate of 28.3 cases per 100,000 population (Vrbova, Johnson, ...\\n\\nZoonoses Public Health. 2020;00:1–9. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH\\n\\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/zph\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Infections\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn 2012, the incidence of Campylobacter infections in Canada increased to 29.1 cases per 100,000 population, making it the leading cause of bacterial gastrointestinal illness (Pintar et al., 2016). Campylobacter in humans can be contracted from various sources, and descriptive studies have been conducted in Ontario to determine the relative importance of these exposures (Vrbova et al., 2012; Whitfield et al., 2017).\\n\\n# Human Exposures to Campylobacter\\n\\nBetween 2007 and 2009, 20.4% of cases were attributed to international travel (Vrbova et al., 2012). Among domestic cases with a documented known exposure, 63.1% were associated with food, 26.9% with contact with animals, 6% with contact with an infected individual, and 2.8% with contact with contaminated water (Vrbova et al., 2012).\\n\\n# Species of Campylobacter\\n\\nThere are two main species of zoonotic Campylobacter that affect humans: C. jejuni and C. coli. C. jejuni is the most common zoonotic species, while C. coli accounts for only 4% of confirmed human cases (Epps et al., 2013).\\n\\n# Seasonality of Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nCampylobacteriosis demonstrates a seasonal pattern, with cases increasing in the spring, peaking in June and July, and decreasing throughout late summer and autumn (Baker et al., 2012; Gölz et al., 2014; Keegan et al., 2009; Naumova et al., 2007; Olson et al.). Factors affecting hydrological dynamics, such as precipitation events or watershed flow, may influence the distribution of Campylobacter in the environment and subsequent human exposure (Baker et al., 2012).\\n\\n# Impacts\\n\\n- Environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation are linked with higher rates of human Campylobacter infections in various regions of Ontario.\\n- Understanding these relationships can help anticipate potential increases in human Campylobacter infections to better prepare for increased public health resource needs.\\n- Understanding these relationships can also allow us to identify how patterns of human Campylobacter infection may change in the future due to climate change.\\n\\n# Figure 1: Map of Southern Ontario\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter in Ontario\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter in Ontario\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nCOUSINS et al. discuss the behavior changes including increased barbequing and picnics, increased contact with recreational waters, and changes in wildlife and insect movement and populations including migratory birds and flies (Nichols, 2005; Olson et al., 2008). Previous studies have not examined any specific climatic or hydrological factors that may be driving the observed seasonality.\\n\\nThe objectives of this study were to: (a) identify environmental conditions associated with the occurrence of Campylobacter in humans in four regions of Ontario, and (b) identify pooled measures of effect across all four regions and identify potential sources of heterogeneity.

These regions differed in terms of the major water reservoir, agricultural density, and population size (Table 1).

The Durham health region contains the smallest water reservoir (123 km²) but the second highest population (Central Lake Ontario Conservation, 2002; Statistics Canada, 2017).\\n\\n# 2.2 Human Case Data\\n\\nIn Ontario, campylobacteriosis is a reportable disease to the Public Health Agency of Ontario (PHO). Nine years (1 January 2005 to 31 January 2014) of human case count data were obtained from PHO. The data represent confirmed cases of Campylobacter from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). Individual patients were recorded as Campylobacter positive if the pathogen had been isolated from stool or body fluids or if they were symptomatic and had a documented epidemiological link to one or more laboratory-confirmed cases. Cases were further separated by pathogen species, C. jejuni or C. coli. All other pathogen species were removed from the data set due to a lack of evidence of zoonotic transmission. For the purpose of this study, we assumed that time-lagged environmental conditions would be most relevant for index/primary cases, and therefore, secondary cases that were epidemiologically linked to primary cases were removed from the data set. Cases that had travelled outside of Ontario within the incubation period of Campylobacter were excluded as it was assumed that these do not represent locally acquired cases. The resulting human data set represented all laboratory-confirmed primary cases of C. jejuni and C. coli within each of the four health regions that were not travel-related and that occurred between 1 January 2005 and 31 January 2014.\\n\\n# 2.3 Environmental Data\\n\\nMeteorological data including temperature (°C) and precipitation (mm) as well as hydrological data including river level (m) and flow (m³/s) of the local watershed were obtained from Environment Canada for the period of 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014. In most cases, the weather station from the most populous area within the health region and the largest watershed within each health region (see Table 1) were used to generate a daily environmental data set for each health region.\\n\\n# Table 1: Demographic and Geographic Characteristics of the Four Health Regions Examined\\n\\n|Health Region|Population (a)|Agricultural Density (farms/km²) (a)|Size of Primary Watershed (km²)|Top Two Land Uses Surrounding Watershed|Regulated or Natural|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Waterloo (1)|507,095|1.015|6,800 (b)|Agriculture pastures (44%) (b) Agriculture crops (34%) (b)|Regulated (b)|\\n|Wellington–Dufferin–Guelph (2)|261,965|0.606|6,800 (b)|Agriculture pastures (44%) (b) Agriculture crops (34%) (b)|Regulated (b)|\\n|York (3)|1,032,525|0.470|600 (c)|Agriculture (53%) (c) Urban (23%) (c)|Natural (c)|\\n|Durham (4)|608,124|0.576|123 (d)|Agriculture crops (51%) (d) Agricultural pastures (18%) (d)|Natural (d)|\\n\\n(a) Statistics Canada (2017).\\n\\n(b) Grand River Conservation Authority (2014).\\n\\n(c) The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority (2000).\\n\\n(d) Central Lake Ontario Conservation (2002).\\n---\\n# Statistical Methods in Environmental Health Research\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Statistical Methods\\n\\n# 2.4 Assessing Seasonality\\n\\nEnvironmental exposure data and human case data were aggregated to weekly values (e.g. summing all reported human cases and averaging environmental and hydrological exposure data for each week). The environmental data were also lagged one to four weeks (Louis et al., 2005) to account for the expected time delay between the hypothesized environmental impact and subsequent identification of a human case. Seasonality was assessed using fast Fourier transformations (Fisman, 2007; Scharlemann et al., 2008) by adding oscillatory smoothers (sine and cosine terms). Sine and cosine terms that were statistically significant (p < .05) were indicative of a seasonal trend. A yearly effect was assessed by adding a year term to the models. The yearly population of the health region was added as a denominator to account for the changing baseline.\\n\\n# 2.4.2 Case Cross-Over Analysis\\n\\nA time-stratified case cross-over is a study design used to evaluate acute associations between exposure variables and a case using self-matching in situations where cases are relatively rare (Janes, Sheppard, & Lumley, 2005; Lu & Zeger, 2007; Maclure, 1991; Maclure & Mittleman, 2000). Conceptually, this approach is similar to a matched case–control study design. In this case, the study design compares the environmental exposures that were documented during the time period preceding a case (the hazard period) to the environmental exposures that occurred during the time period in which a case did not occur (the control period). This allows for the identification of unique, acute differences in exposure status that are associated with case occurrence. In this context, a case is considered a day on which campylobacteriosis was identified, and a control was any day in which a case did not occur matched by day of week. A time-stratified design was used to prevent time-trend bias by accounting for seasonality and enabling the estimation of short-term effects (Janes et al., 2005). This was done by using 4-week periods for the selection of each control period, matched within the stratum by day of week.\\n\\nHuman cases from the data set (1 January 2005 to 31 January 2014) were self-matched by day of week using a three-week hazard period (White et al., 2009). Four control periods were matched by day of week, with each case hazard period. Control periods were chosen at random and could precede, straddle or follow the hazard period. The environmental predictor variables were averaged weekly and lagged from 1 to 4 weeks to assess temporal associations with human cases. Univariable conditional logistic regression was used to compare between the different regions for the three different exposures (temperature, precipitation and water flow) at 4 different time lags (1–4 weeks). Multivariable conditional regression models were generated for each region using identical environmental exposures (temperature, precipitation and water flow) at 1–4 week lags to be used for the meta-analysis.\\n\\n# 2.4.3 Meta-Analysis\\n\\nAfter the case cross-over analysis, meta-analysis was performed as a post hoc analysis to further explore the heterogeneity found in the results. Using the odds ratios (OR) that resulted from the case cross-over analysis for each exposure at each lag in the four regions, we estimated the pooled effect of the odds ratio for all four regions together, using random effects meta-analytic methods. The between-region heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrane's Q-statistic (Deeks & Altman, 2008; Logar-Henderson, Ling, Tuite, & Fisman, 2019). Univariable and multivariable meta-regression models were used to explore potential sources of heterogeneity, where I² was above 30% and a p-value for heterogeneity <.10 were used as cut-offs for further exploration. The potential sources evaluated included agricultural density, population density and size of the local watershed along with the mean and standard deviation of each of the environmental exposure variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata v14.2 (Stata Corporation).\\n\\n# 3 Results\\n\\n# 3.1 Descriptive Statistics\"),\n",

The yearly trend was significant in two of the four health regions, showing that cases were decreasing over time in Waterloo (coefficient = 0.940, 95% CI: 0.903–0.979, p = .003) and York (coefficient = 0.934, 95% CI: 0.923–0.955, p < .0001) health regions. However, in the other two health regions examined (Wellington and Durham), there was no year over year change in the observed pattern of cases.\\n\\nThe direction and magnitude of effects varied across health regions. In the univariable analysis, increased mean temperature was associated with increased odds of campylobacteriosis after a 1-week lag in the Wellington–Dufferin–Guelph health region, at 1-, 3-, and 4-week lags in the York region, and at 1- and 4-week lags in the Durham region (Table S1). Increased precipitation was associated with lower odds of campylobacteriosis in Wellington and York regions at 2- and 3-week lags, respectively (Table S1). Increased water flow was not statistically significant in any of the health regions at any lag (Table S1). Odds ratios from the multivariable conditional regression models that included all exposures (Table S2) were carried forward into the meta-analytic analysis.\\n\\n# 3.3 Case Cross-Over Analysis\\n\\nUnivariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression models were created for each health region with the exposure variables of mean temperature, total precipitation and water flow at all time lags.\\n\\n# 3.4 Meta-Analysis\\n\\nBased on the pooled effect size, mean temperature was associated with increased odds of campylobacteriosis at a 1-week lag (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02, 1.04) and was homogenous across regions.\\n\\n# Figure 2: Average incidence of Campylobacter per 100,000 population by month\\n\\nThe data span 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2013 and is separated by health region.

With the changing climate, it is important to understand baseline characteristics of pathogens such as these in order to be prepared for how disease incidence may change in the future as regional temperature and precipitation profiles change.\\n\\n# 4.1 Seasonality\\n\\nCampylobacter, like most other enteric pathogens, cause illness in males more often than females, and are most apparent in young children and young adults. Our results are consistent with previous studies in this regard. Our results also demonstrate the expected seasonal and yearly patterns of human campylobacteriosis that have been observed in other parts of the country and the world.\\n\\n# 4.2 Case cross-over and meta-analysis\\n\\nMean ambient temperature was a significant predictor in the case cross-over analysis and meta-analysis, with increased ambient temperature being associated with increased odds of campylobacteriosis after a lag of 1 week in all health regions separately, and when pooled together. This suggests that Campylobacter bacteria are affected by the ambient temperature which influences human campylobacteriosis cases.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3, h4 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 40px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .conflict-of-interest, .limitations, .references {\\nmargin-top: 30px;\\nborder-top: 1px solid #ccc;\\npadding-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacteriosis\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\nHuman cases were positively associated with average temperature and sunlight 4 weeks prior to case onset. There was an unstable lag effect between the regions with associations at 3- and 4-weeks in two of the regions. These variations could in part be due to the differences in the regions’ size and regulation of their watersheds, but it is difficult to determine this. The pooled measure of effect suggested that mean temperature at a one-week lag was associated with an increase in the odds of human campylobacteriosis in a homogenous manner across all health regions investigated. This finding is consistent with the biology of the pathogen. At low temperatures (0–4°C), Campylobacter survives longer in the environment; however, it is in a dormant, non-pathogenic state (Baker et al., 2012).\\n\\nThe case cross-over analysis showed that lower total precipitation was associated with increased odds of campylobacteriosis in two of the four health units. Similar results have been found in an analysis of diarrhoeal incidence in children worldwide where a negative association was found with rainfall (Lloyd, Kovats, & Armstrong, 2007). Similarly, in Australia, a negative relationship between weekly rainfall suggests that extended dry periods may also affect the transmission of enteric pathogens (Hu, Mengersen, Fu, & Tong, 2010). However, when pooled across the health regions, no significant associations were found but similar analysis has not been done with campylobacteriosis or other gastrointestinal illnesses for comparison.\\n\\nWater flow of the local watershed was not associated with the outcome of interest in the case cross-over analysis in any of the health regions at any lag period or when pooled across the health regions. This suggests that the hydrology of the local watershed may not be a contributing factor to human campylobacteriosis incidence in Ontario.\\n\\nIn some instances, significant heterogeneity between the different health regions was observed. We hypothesized that the difference between the health regions could be explained by the differences in their watershed size, population density, and agricultural density and evaluated this hypothesis using meta-regression. Waterloo and Wellington–Dufferin–Guelph share the Grand River, which is a highly regulated water system and the urban area is surrounded by agricultural land (Grand River Conservation Authority, 2014). In Durham, the Oshawa creek is a very small watershed which is also primarily used for agricultural purposes (Central Lake Ontario Conservation, 2002). The York health region, however, uses an unregulated watershed which is dominated by urban centres with high population density (The Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, 2000). However, meta-regression analysis did not identify any of these factors as significant explanatory variables for the observed heterogeneity between the regions.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, Campylobacter are associated with some environmental factors and these factors can influence how the bacteria interact with humans. After adjusting for seasonality, we found biologically plausible timing for the environmental factors studied, mean temperature and total precipitation, which complement the current knowledge for this pathogen. With further research, we will be able to better understand Campylobacter transmission and dynamics in humans in Ontario, Canada. The associations between environmental factors and human incidence could then be used as part of a new system (similar to the way a syndromic surveillance system works) that could use environmental factors as ‘red flags’ to highlight the potential increased risk of outbreaks. For example, if Ontario is experiencing a warmer than usual spring, this may be picked up by the system as a potential high-risk outbreak situation. This could then allow public health to be on alert for outbreaks or higher counts than usual of Campylobacter. Also, with the growing threat of climate change, these baseline associations can help inform predictions of how the rate of campylobacteriosis may change in the future.\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors thank Ms. Enise Decaluwe-Tulk for her work to develop our teams' One Health database for enteric pathogens in the province of Ontario and for compiling all of the environmental data required for this project.

Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of Cryptosporidium positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human Cryptosporidium infection. Annual seasonality was found for both human cases and bovine cases with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in late winter to early spring. Bovine cases that occurred 21 days prior to human cases were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of human case occurrence. At both 9 and 14 days prior to human case onset, the odds of a human case increased twofold per 10-degree Celsius increase in air temperature. These results provide a preliminary hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from cattle to humans via the environment and suggest that the timing of environmental conditions in relation to case occurrence is biologically plausible.\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n#\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nFunding for this work was provided by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)\\n(http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html) and the\\nCanada Research Chairs Program\\n(http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx).\\nThe funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\\n\\n# Competing Interests\\n\\nThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis is a human enteric illness that is reportable in the province of Ontario, Canada and is characterized by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain [1]. In Ontario, 1,048 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported between 2007 and 2009, representing a mean annual incidence rate of 2.7 cases of illness per 100,000 population [2]. The highest incidence rates were reported in Southwestern Ontario [3]. Sources of Cryptosporidium infection in humans include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture [1,4]. Contaminated municipal drinking water is also a source of infection [1,4].\\n\\nIn humans, two species of Cryptosporidium (C. hominis and C. parvum) are responsible for the majority of Cryptosporidium infections [5]. C. hominis is specific to humans, while C. parvum is a zoonotic pathogen that has a wide range of hosts, including cattle [6]. C. parvum is responsible for approximately 85% of Cryptosporidium infections in pre-weaned calves [7,8]. In addition, nearly 100% of dairy calves become infected with C. parvum during their lifetime [6,7].\\n\\nThe seasonality of cryptosporidiosis has been well described. Human cryptosporidiosis cases occur seasonally, with a higher prevalence of disease during warmer and wetter months [9–11]. Specifically, within Ontario, Canada, human cryptosporidiosis peaks in the summer months [1–3]. Interestingly, a study from Prince Edward Island demonstrated a distinct spring peak in human shedding of C. parvum while C. hominis was most frequently detected between the months of July to September [5].\\n\\nThe manure of infected animals acts as a significant reservoir for C. parvum [12]. Infected calves can excrete up to 107 oocysts per gram of feces, leading to the shedding of millions of oocysts within the typical one- to two-week infection period [6,10,13,14]. The potential for environmental contamination leading to human exposure occurs when pathogen-loaded manure is spread onto fields as fertilizer, followed by high levels of precipitation [15,16]. Intense precipitation events cause varying degrees of surface water runoff, which can carry oocysts from farms into nearby watersheds, creating high pathogen loads and increasing opportunities for contact with humans [9,10,16]. Oocysts persist within cool moist environments, including manure, and remain viable for months in temperatures between 0˚C and 20˚C [17]. Once the pathogen enters the watershed, it becomes a human health hazard for those using surface water, such as rivers and lakes, for recreational purposes. In addition, oocysts may be resistant to conventional water treatment methods such as chlorine disinfection [18] and thus, may pose a risk for municipal drinking water.\\n\\nIn Ontario, contact with animals or with surface water are the main risk factors for human Cryptosporidium infections; 46.3% of 301 reported human cryptosporidiosis cases were linked to animal contact, and 38.5% were linked to surface water contact [4]. Local hydrological characteristics, such as water flow and level, may be important factors in the transmission of the pathogen, as oocysts can be distributed through watersheds. Indeed, the concentration of Cryptosporidium is significantly and positively correlated with water flow and turbidity during rainfall events [19].\\n\\nWhile studies have demonstrated associations between each type of exposure (weather, hydrology, and veterinary health) and human illness, no known study has attempted to assess all of these factors concurrently to examine cryptosporidiosis at the human-animal-environment interface. This is the idea behind the One Health concept, a paradigm that regards human, animal and environmental health as inter-related, and seeks to develop linkages between human and veterinary realms [20].\\n\\nThus, the objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of human cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario, Canada; and 2) to determine the...\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n#\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Distribution of Human Cryptosporidiosis'),\n",

These counties share the Grand River watershed, which has a total drainage area of 6800 km2 [16]. The majority of the watershed is surrounded by agricultural land and is home to 1294 cattle farms with a total cattle population of 233,652 [21]. Most cattle farms in this region are dairy producers. The watershed is managed by a system of seven dams and multiple reservoirs to regulate water flow in the area. The central part of the region is heavily urbanized, with five major health regions.\\n\\nFig 1. Map of Wellington and Waterloo counties (shaded) of Southwestern Ontario, Canada.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196573 | April 26, 2018\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n#\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Human Case Data\\n\\nData on human cryptosporidiosis cases between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2015 from Waterloo Region and Wellington, Dufferin, Guelph health unit areas were obtained from Public Health Ontario. Cryptosporidiosis is a reportable disease in Ontario and human case data represent cases reported to local public health agencies and then communicated to the Provincial health authority. Data were extracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), the electronic reporting system for reportable diseases in the province. A case was defined as an individual with laboratory-confirmed infection, with or without clinically compatible signs and symptoms, from an appropriate clinical specimen (i.e. stool). Cases associated with travel outside the province of Ontario during the relevant incubation period were excluded. A total of 87 cases were reported over the time period including 50 cases from Waterloo Region and 37 cases from Wellington, Dufferin, and Guelph. Daily case counts were aggregated to monthly case counts to assess seasonality and weekly case counts for univariate analyses.\\n\\n# Cattle Farm Data\\n\\nData on bovine Cryptosporidium infections from farms located within the Waterloo Region and Wellington, Dufferin, Guelph health unit areas from January 1, 2008 to September 30, 2014 were obtained from the University of Guelph, Animal Health Laboratory (AHL). These data represent clinical samples submitted by Veterinarians to the AHL for diagnostic laboratory testing. While each submission to the lab could include clinical samples collected from multiple animals from a single farm, for our purposes, laboratory-confirmed “cases” were considered to represent farm-level positivity. Typically, veterinarians will not submit an individual sample from every symptomatic animal on a farm because a single positive laboratory result is enough to warrant treatment of groups within the herd. In this case, a farm was labelled “pathogen-positive” if any of the submitted clinical samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium. Within the region there were a total of 214 reported Cryptosporidium positive farms over the time period and cases were relatively evenly distributed throughout the two regions. For our purposes, cattle cases will refer to counts of laboratory-confirmed positive cattle farms. Daily positive, cattle farm counts were aggregated to monthly case counts to assess seasonality and weekly case counts for univariate analyses.\\n\\n# Environmental Exposure Data\\n\\nHydrological data including daily flow (m3/s) and water level (m) from 18 Hydrometric Stations within the Grand River Watershed for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014 were obtained from Environment Canada’s Water office website. Daily water flow and level parameters for individual waterways were combined as average daily water flow and average water level for each region. Meteorological data including daily total precipitation (mm) and maximum air temperature (˚C) for the period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2014 were obtained and averaged from two major Environment Canada active weather stations located in Fergus, ON (central Wellington County) and Waterloo, ON (central Waterloo County). Daily exposure data were aggregated into weekly exposure variables and one- to six-week lagged exposure variables.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196573 | April 26, 2018\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Statistical Analyses\\n\\nWe evaluated the seasonal trends in disease occurrence using zero-inflated Poisson regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. Seasonal trends in human cases were assessed during the time period between January 1, 2009 and January 31, 2015 (the full dataset that was available for human cases). The seasonal analysis for positive bovine farms was conducted for the time period between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2014 (the full dataset that was available for bovine positive farms).\\n\\nThe associations between weekly aggregated environmental exposures, weekly lagged environmental exposures (with one- to six-week lags), and weekly case counts were evaluated using both univariable and multivariable zero-inflated Poisson regression models for the time period between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2014. This analysis utilized a shortened human dataset in order to match the available bovine farm dataset. Oscillatory seasonal smoothers, using sine and cosine terms, were included to control for non-specific seasonality of disease occurrence in such a way that environmental exposure variables identified as statistically significant would describe effects in excess of what would be expected based on seasonal oscillation alone [25].\\n\\nUnivariable models were used to assess unconditional associations between case counts and the exposure variables of interest. Exposure variables with p < 0.2 were considered to be of interest for a multivariable analysis [26].\\n\\nData were further analysed using a case-crossover approach to evaluate acute associations between human case occurrence and daily environmental exposures (including bovine cases) for the time period between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2014. For this analysis, human and bovine case data along with environmental exposure data were no longer aggregated but were instead characterized by calendar day. This study design compares exposures identified during a defined hazard period directly prior to case onset with self-matched control periods. Exposures that increase the probability of case occurrence are expected to occur with greater frequency during the hazard period. This approach is used for evaluating the relationship between acute, short-term exposures and rare outcomes [27].\\n\\nWe used a time-stratified, 4:1 matched design in which four control periods were created and matched by day of week to each case onset day. To reduce bias we used random directionality for control period selection, such that control periods could follow, precede, or straddle the hazard period [28]. For this analysis, daily predictor variables, including 0 to 28 day lagged exposures were assessed for associations with human cases. Odds ratios for case occurrence were estimated using conditional logistic regression models. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA 14.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Seasonality\\n\\nWe investigated 87 cases of human and 214 cases of cattle farm Cryptosporidium infection within the Wellington/Waterloo region. There was evidence for annual seasonality of both human cases (p < 0.001) and bovine cases (p = 0.027) with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in winter to early spring (Fig 2). There was no evidence for a yearly trend over the time period for either human or cattle cases.\\n\\n# Zero-inflated Poisson Regression'),\n",

The peak in cattle cases in the late winter/early spring prior to the summer peak in human cases is suggestive of zoonotic transmission. Destruction of oocysts has been demonstrated over winter in ambient temperatures fluctuating between -9˚C and +9˚C [30]. Similarly, oocysts become inactive in a 0˚C environment [17]. It has been postulated that shear forces generated during freeze-thaw cycles destroys the parasites eliminating their ability to infect hosts [30]. This suggests that Cryptosporidium oocysts entering the environment from human infections would fail to persist over the typical winter in a Canadian climate, thereby likely eliminating humans as a potential reservoir for cattle infection. Conversely, oocysts may survive for extended periods in a 15˚C environment [17]. This corresponds to typical springtime temperatures in Southwestern Ontario and would support the theory that late winter cattle cryptosporidiosis affects human case onset in the summer months.\\n\\nMaximum ambient air temperature at 0, 9, and 14 days prior to human case onset was positively associated with human illness. These results are consistent with past research demonstrating that temperature of the current month, as well as temperature lagged by 1, 2 [31] and 3 months [32] were positively associated with human cryptosporidiosis. These results may seem counterintuitive given that the optimum conditions for oocyst survival and infectivity includes somewhat cooler temperatures [17]. However, this may be explained by people participating in outdoor recreation to a greater extent in warmer temperatures thereby increasing human exposure to pathogen-loaded surface waters.\\n\\nPrevious studies have shown that heavy rainfall is associated with an increased incidence of waterborne illness. A two-fold increase in the odds of a waterborne disease outbreak was found for rainfall events greater than the 93rd percentile compared with rainfall events less than the 93rd percentile [33]. Similarly, a significant increase in weekly cryptosporidiosis rates has been demonstrated for accumulated rainfall above the 75th percentile for the previous week [34]. In theory, heavy rainfall should flush manure and any associated pathogens into surface water sources. Indeed, the concentration of Cryptosporidium spp. has been shown to be positively correlated with water flow and turbidity during rainfall events [19] however, not all species of Cryptosporidium are associated with human illness.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196573 April 26, 2018\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nThe results from the present study found no association between rainfall and the incidence of human cryptosporidiosis. These results are consistent with a small body of evidence finding either no association [31] or a negative association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis incidence [35]. Similarly, a study from England and Wales reported that 20% of waterborne disease outbreaks in the twentieth century were associated with extended periods of low rainfall compared with 10% of outbreaks associated with periods of heavy rainfall [36].\\n\\nCorrespondingly, the current study demonstrated that higher average water levels 19–20 days prior to human case onset are associated with lower odds of human illness. It is possible that periods of low rainfall can lead to increased pathogen concentration in environmental water sources resulting in an increased likelihood of infection. By the same token, increased water levels in waterways may dilute the concentration of oocysts thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for those in contact with these water sources.'),\n",

By the same token, increased water levels in waterways may dilute the concentration of oocysts thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for those in contact with these water sources.\\n\\nWhile hydrological factors such as stream flow may impact the movement of pathogens at the soil level, this study found a negative association between average water flow and the incidence of human illness 28 days prior to case onset. Thus, higher water flow was associated with lower odds of human illness. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the detection of high densities of Cryptosporidium oocysts has been associated with low stream flow [37]. When water flow conditions are insufficient to dilute or flush pathogens from waterways, it could be hypothesized that pathogens may become concentrated. Conversely, high water flow may dilute or flush pathogens from waterways.\\n\\nIt is likely that the manipulation of the watershed via the dam and reservoir system that exists within this region confounded the effect of rainfall and watershed variables on human illness in the present study. Reservoirs in the Grand River watershed fill during the spring runoff and reach peak levels at the beginning of June. Some of the water is stored in order to reduce downstream flood peaks during this time. As natural flows decline in the summer and fall, the water stored in the reservoirs is slowly released to add to the natural flows in the river system. For example, in 2012, water flow augmentation via the reservoir system peaked in July and August [38]. The slow release of water from the reservoir system during periods of dry weather creates a more consistent water level and flow throughout the season, resulting in an artificial assessment of the effects of rainfall and hydrology variables on the risk of human illness within this region.\\n\\nOverall, the results from this study provide a preliminary hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from cattle to humans via the environment, suggesting that the timing of environmental conditions in relation to case occurrence is biologically plausible. Human cryptosporidiosis has an average incubation period of seven days [39]. This dynamic may explain the relationship with environmental conditions 9 to 14 days prior to cases occurring as well as the presence of positive cattle farms occurring 21 days prior to human cases. The lag times in this study provided sufficient time for the environment to be contaminated, for humans to be exposed to the contaminated environment via recreational use of surface waters, for an appropriate incubation period in humans, and for people to seek medical care and submit a stool sample. While we cannot assume a causal association between temperature, positive cattle farms, and human cryptosporidiosis risk, we believe that our results provide an indication of specific, high-risk time periods when human infections are more likely to occur. Identification of these higher risk periods can be communicated to the public in order to reduce the likelihood of exposure via recreational waters.\\n\\nTwo fundamentally different methods of analysis were used in this study and produced contrasting results. The regression analysis evaluated aggregated case counts in relation to weekly averaged measures of environmental exposures, while the case-crossover methodology evaluated the acute effect of daily environmental exposures on the occurrence of human cases.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196573 April 26, 2018\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe difference in results between the two analytical methods may represent an example of “ecological fallacy” from the use of weekly aggregated case and exposure data. An ecological fallacy occurs when an analysis of aggregated data is used to draw conclusions about an individual’s risk of illness [40]. This emphasizes the importance of supplementing traditional epidemiological analysis with complementary methodologies when examining the effects of acute environmental exposures on health outcomes.\\n\\n# Limitations\\n\\nRelatively few human cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in Waterloo and Wellington, Dufferin, Guelph health regions during the study period. While cryptosporidiosis is a reportable illness in Ontario, underreporting of acute gastrointestinal illness in Ontario is quite common [41]. Treatment for mild gastrointestinal illness tends to focus on supportive therapy including rest and rehydration and people may self-treat based on experience rather than seek medical care. As with human gastrointestinal illness, cattle farm data likely represents only a portion of all farms experiencing disease in their herds. Cattle Cryptosporidium infection is quite common and farmers are likely to treat their livestock based on experience, without help from a veterinarian or lab confirmed diagnosis, which may limit our statistical power.\\n\\nMisclassification in terms of human case location may have biased the results. For location purposes in public health surveillance, human cases are counted in the health unit of primary residence. Thus, illness acquired elsewhere will still be counted as a case for the health unit in which the case resides. Similarly, the location data for cattle cases are typically based on veterinary location rather than farm premise location. Veterinary premises may not be located within the same health region as the farms they service. Therefore, we cannot be certain of the exact location of infected farms.\\n\\nMolecular epidemiology was not available for either human or cattle cases. Similarly, environmental sampling data were not available. While the results provide evidence for the linkages between human, animal, and environment, we cannot be certain that all three entities were infected or contaminated with the same species of Cryptosporidium. In a study such as this one, where we have evaluated multiple environmental and livestock exposures it may be important to consider the role of multiplicity and consider how many exposures we might expect to be positive by chance alone.\\n\\n# Future Research Directions\\n\\nFuture research should include fieldwork that includes environmental sampling and genetic identification of Cryptosporidium species. Additional environmental exposures, including UV index, should also be assessed as ultraviolet rays have been shown to reduce the length of time that the Cryptosporidium oocyst is able to remain viable [42]. Future studies should include regions without a dam system to control for the confounding effect of such a system. The addition of these factors may provide further insight into the transmission dynamics of cryptosporidiosis as well as reveal additional conditions under which an increased or decreased risk of infection may occur.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, our results identify specific conditions within the environment that are associated with an increased risk of cryptosporidiosis in humans in the southwestern region of Ontario, Canada. These findings lead to a biologically plausible explanation for the observed seasonality of the disease and identify environmental conditions putting people at an increased risk for illness. Ongoing research in this area will enable us to build a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of Cryptosporidium as a zoonotic pathogen in order to better prevent and control pathogen spread amongst cattle, people and within the environment.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196573 April 26, 2018\\n---\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n#\\n# Environmental and Agricultural Drivers of Human Cryptosporidiosis\\n\\n# Acknowledgments\\n\\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. Beverly McEwen who extracted the cattle case data from the Animal Health Laboratory database.\\n\\n# Author Contributions'),\n",

This flagellated organism, when present in the gut of human beings, is associated with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting [1].\\n\\nBoth the duration and severity of Giardia infection are extremely variable, requiring in some cases hospitalization [2—4]. Fortunately, for the majority of infected persons, the symptoms generally subside within 2—3 weeks in otherwise healthy individuals. However, in some cases, this infectious disease has long-term consequences, including chronic diarrhea with or without intestinal malabsorption, recurrent abdominal pain, and weight loss [1,5].\\n\\nData from surveys, excluding documented outbreaks, indicate that in industrialized countries, the prevalence rate of Giardia infection ranges between 2% and 5%; in contrast, it varies from 20% to 30% in developing countries [1]. Data on the prevalence of giardiasis in many countries is limited, as is the case for Cuba. However, in Cuba, the last national survey performed in 2009 found an overall prevalence of Giardia infection estimated at a level of 6.02% [6], similar to the 7.2% found in the previous national survey performed in 1984 (unpublished report). Despite this decrease, higher rates of prevalence were found among young children attending day-care centers and primary schools [7—10], which is presumably related to the poor hygiene of such children and the way this facilitates the fecal—oral transmission of Giardia cysts.\\n\\nSimilar to vector-borne infectious diseases [11,12], food-borne (parasitic and non-parasitic) infections could be associated with multiple factors, including changes in environmental and social elements that may influence their epidemiology [12,13]. In particular, the effects of climate change and variability have been studied in many vector-borne diseases, such as malaria [14], dengue [11,12], and leishmaniasis [15], but not for intestinal protozoan diseases, such as giardiasis.\\n\\nIf climate is influencing the epidemiology of such diseases, environmental control efforts are necessary, which requires an integrated and systematic approach at both the national and community level to reduce and mitigate the impact on disease epidemiology; such efforts are obviously linked to educational programs and other interventional measures [16].\\n\\nThe climate may also influence the complex interacting factors, including where Giardia cysts can be found and favored; in this way, the possibility to produce disease could be increased significantly. This influence of climate on the spread of Giardia infection could be an interesting subject of investigation.\\n\\nA Mexican study, using data from the period of 1976 to 1988, analyzed the seasonality of giardiasis at the national and state levels and found that for that period, this disease had a stable pattern of highest incidence in the months of July and August for the country and in 11 states of the country [17].\\n\\nBased on the above-mentioned background, in this first study, we assessed the potential associations between macroclimatic variation and giardiasis cases in the context of a provincial parasitological survey in three different geographical settings of Cuba.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Giardiasis in Cuba\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n.caption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #7f8c8d;\\n}\\n\\n# Giardiasis Incidence in Children and Adults in Cuba (2010-2012)\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Setting'),\n",

Havana, the capital of Cuba, has a population of 2,106,146 (according to the 2012 census); Ciego de Ávila, 422,576 pop., and Guantánamo, 510,863 pop., are two other major population centers in Cuba. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Cuba ranks 59th in the Human Development Index for 2012 (0.780), with a life expectancy of 79.3 years (source).\\n\\nWith the increasing participation of women (including mothers) in the paid labor force, a resulting demand for child care options has arisen. In Cuba, one of the formal options (i.e., regulated care settings) in child care arrangements are daycare centers (DCC), each of which are similar in terms of the facilities, organization, and the level of training of their staff. Children aged from 1 to 5 years spend nearly 8 hours a day in DCCs. In a DCC, in addition to regular care and educational activities, children are surveyed for intestinal parasites every 6 months. A fecal specimen, collected by parents or relatives, is obtained from each child and examined for the presence of parasitic and commensal intestinal infections by direct wet mount (a technique primarily to detect motile protozoan trophozoites, e.g., Giardia) and brine flotation techniques (used to confirm the presence of the parasite, the lower weight of the parasite can be identified by this technique, the parasite will float to the test tube mouth or the bottle mouth, where samples can be obtained of specimens such as the stool or other type). Families receive the results of the laboratory diagnosis, and all of those who harbored pathogenic intestinal parasites are referred to the appropriate healthcare units (mainly to their family doctors), where they may receive specific treatment and follow-up treatments.\\n\\n# Study Design\\n\\nFor this record-based, ecological study, the epidemiological data were constituted of all of the half-year records of the confirmed giardiasis cases in children and adults (workers of children schools) diagnosed during the period January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, according to the methodology previously described. Sampling was performed at three different provinces of Cuba that covers a sample per province: Havana (capital), Ciego de Ávila (central area of the island), and Guantánamo (southeastern region) (Fig. 1). The giardiasis incidence rate was calculated as the number of cases per 10,000 population (pop.) per period (6 months). Accurate data on giardiasis was not available before 2010. Because the investigation was retrospective and based entirely on the results of the routine investigation of children and the staff of the DCCs, informed consent was not obtained specifically for the purposes of the present study.\\n\\n# Climatic Data\\n\\nThe climatic data were based on one global macro-climatic index, the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), classifying the climatic periods according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, USA) classification, and the months were categorized as El Niño, Neutral, and La Niña to establish differences in the giardiasis incidence according to those climatic periods.\\n\\nFigure 1: Study locations in Cuba during the period of January 2010—December 2012: the provinces of Havana (3), Ciego de Ávila (9), and Guantánamo (15).\\n---\\n# Macroclimatic Impact on Giardiasis Epidemiology\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Macroclimatic Impact on Giardiasis Epidemiology\\n\\n# Satellite Images\\n\\nMonthly satellite images for Total Rainfall were obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) imagery database NASA Earth Observations (NEO, NASA, USA) (http://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and analyzed for Cuba using the Google Earth® software.\\n\\n# Data Management and Statistical Analysis\\n\\nQualitative and quantitative comparisons were performed for the different climatic periods. Nonlinear Poisson regression models were used for determining potential associations between the climatic and the epidemiological variables analyzed at the semester level. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 11.0®.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Giardiasis Incidence\\n\\nDuring the study period, 293,019 subjects were assessed, with 80.6% children and 19.4% workers. Of these subjects, 6,357 were found to be positive for Giardia, representing a global rate of 216.95 cases/10,000 pop. (95% CI 211.7—222.2). The cumulated rates for children were significantly higher, 244.73 cases/10,000 pop. (95% CI 238.5—251.0), compared to the workers, 101.82 cases/10,000 pop. (95% CI 93.5—110.2) (Table 1). Globally, there were significant differences in the cumulated rates among the three provinces assessed, with the highest rate at Guantánamo (413.6 cases/10,000 pop.; 95% CI 413.6—455.4) (Table 1). This difference was also found for children and workers (Table 1).\\n\\nTime variation in giardiasis during these 3 years exhibited different patterns according to children and workers and the three assessed provinces in Cuba (Fig. 2), varying from 35.8 to 521.9 cases/10,000 pop. (in workers) and from 88.1 to 525.8 cases/10,000 pop. (in children) (Fig. 2).\\n\\n# Climatic Impact on Giardiasis Incidence\\n\\nDuring the considered climatic periods there was a significant change from an ONI of −1.33 (La Niña) to +0.70 (El Niño). These patterns for the macroclimatic indicators were consistent with the observation of the changes in the rain patterns in Cuba, particularly at the assessed provinces, which begin in 2010 with a dry season and little rain (<100 mm) up to a rainy season (>100 mm) in 2011 (Fig. 3).\\n\\nAt Havana and Guantánamo, the incidence rates of giardiasis were higher at higher values of ONI (Table 2), but at Ciego de Ávila, those rates were lower at higher values of ONI (Table 2).\\n\\nNonlinear Poisson regression analysis for Havana, Ciego de Ávila and Guantánamo between the ONI index and the giardiasis incidence showed a significant association (p < 0.01). With lower values of ONI (below 0, La Niña periods) lower incidence of giardiasis was observed at Havana (pseudo r² = 0.0576; LR = 23.05; p < 0.001) and Guantánamo (pseudo r² = 0.0376; LR = 34.05; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4A, 4C). At Ciego de Ávila, with lower values of ONI (below 0, La Niña periods), higher incidence of giardiasis was observed (pseudo r² = 0.0080; LR = 12.88; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B).\\n\\n# Discussion'),\n",

Clinical giardiasis in some countries, such as Cuba, has been reported as a common reason for hospitalization in pediatric hospitals in Havana, the capital city, where, according to a study of risk factors for Giardia infection among hospitalized children, it appears that, at least at the individual level, giardiasis-prevention activities in Havana should be focused on health education to improve personal hygiene and food-related practices.\\n\\nWhere Giardia cysts transmission occurs, multiple factors can affect its dynamics, including environmental phenomena, such as the climate and its variability, and extreme anomaly phenomena, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Such effects on the transmission dynamics are profoundly incident in Latin America, particularly in countries with Ocean Pacific coasts, such as Peru and Ecuador, and in countries with Caribbean coastal regions, such as Honduras, Colombia, and Venezuela, where this has been demonstrated.\\n\\nThe ENSO phenomena is considered as a periodic change in the atmosphere and ocean of the tropical Pacific region, manifested in the atmosphere by changes in pressure and in the ocean by warming or cooling of sea surface at the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean. In South America, the effects of ENSO on tropical diseases, including dengue and leishmaniasis have been well documented; however, regarding giardiasis, there are no reports, either in Latin America or any other region of the World.\\n---\\n# Global Epidemiology of Giardiasis in Cuba (2010-2012)\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n.footer {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Global Epidemiology of Giardiasis in Cuba (2010-2012)\\n\\n|Sampled Subjects|Provinces|Provinces|Provinces|Total|Positive for Giardiasis|Positive for Giardiasis|Positive for Giardiasis|Total| | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Havana|Ciego de Avila|Guantánamo|Havana|Ciego de Avila|Guantánamo| | |\\n|Children|22,547|21,452|4,967|48,966|478|189|257|924|\\n|2010—2|25,618|21,147|5,292|52,057|389|203|245|837|\\n|2011—1|27,557|4,850|5,300|37,707|554|255|218|1,027|\\n|2011—2|21,543|5,517|4,936|31,996|495|230|254|979|\\n|2012—1|21,789|7,397|4,736|33,922|378|367|226|971|\\n|2012—2|20,218|6,318|4,872|31,408|527|298|214|1,039|\\n|Total|139,272|66,681|30,103|236,056|2,821|1,542|1,414|5,777|\\n|%|59.0|28.2|12.8|100.0|Ratesa|202.55|231.25|469.72|\\n|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0|95CI%: 195.1—210.0, 219.8—242.7, 445.7—493.8, 238.5—251.0| | | | | | | | |'),\n",

Measurement of the ENSO phenomena has proven to be useful in vector-borne diseases epidemiology through the use of the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) in modeling one of the independent factors affecting the dynamics of case incidence. However, further studies for intestinal protozoan diseases should be extended and validated in more complete assessments.\\n\\nENSO has two main phases: El Niño, the period when water in the Pacific region is warmer than the mean values (of the temperature during the previous period), and La Niña, the period when the water is colder than the mean values (of the temperature during the previous period). These periods could be measured by the ONI: positive values indicate the El Niño phase, and negative values indicate the La Niña phase. In this study, the El Niño phase was significantly associated with an increase of giardiasis incidence in Havana and Guantánamo. However, in this study at Ciego de Ávila, the trend was the opposite, with higher ONI values (El Niño) corresponding to a significant decrease, according to the regression model.\\n\\nThese results can be explained by the existence of environmental conditions that are influenced by macroclimatic change and that are favorable for cyst viability in relation to the increase of rain, as is reflected in the satellite maps. El Niño in Cuba has probably influenced microclimatic conditions, such as an increase in rainfall and humidity and a lowering of temperatures. However, further studies using those variables in a longer time series of giardiasis incidence are required. In this study, despite its limitations, we found a significant association between climate variability and the incidence of giardiasis at Guantánamo and Havana, which is highly relevant.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nmargin-bottom: 5px;\\n}\\n\\n# Impacts of Climate Variability on Giardiasis Incidence\\n\\nHowever, at Ciego de Avila, we were not able to demonstrate such associations. This discrepancy could be related to the nature of the study, i.e., retrospective and lacking the ability to detect low or mild associations in some environments, such as those in that area of the country. More studies are required to demonstrate if there are significant impacts of climate variability on giardiasis incidence in that region.\\n\\nDespite the limitations of our study (e.g., lack of vegetation data, such as NDVI or EVI, short-time data series, the data used here comes from only a single El Niño to La Niña transition period and cannot reflect trends for multiple events, and the use of microclimatic data), these preliminary results indicated that in this 3-year study, a significant increase of disease is observed during an El Niño event, and with La Niña, a significant decrease is observed. These inputs could be modeled and validated in additional studies using longer time series of more reliable data to develop predictive models. Furthermore, more detailed studies in Cuba and other countries in the Caribbean region are required because these models, with longer data and other variables, can be applied to surveillance via predicting trends in giardiasis and other intestinal protozoan diseases incidence in this and other countries. To improve these analyses on the effect of a variable that changes on a multi-year scale, other drivers of giardiasis should also be considered, as has been proposed for dengue.\\n\\nThe results of the potential impacts of climate variability on giardiasis epidemiology should be considered in public health policies, particularly those focused on surveillance, forecast and prediction of disease.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nPresentation at that meeting was partially funded by the Vicerrectoría de Investigaciones, Innovación y Extensión de la Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (#19122012), Pereira, Colombia.

Weekly admission of rotavirus diarrhoea (1993–2003) in children aged <5 years and weekly average temperature and relative humidity for each city were modelled using a log-linear model with a cubic trend and season. Interactions were included to test for differences in the effect of temperature and humidity between seasons and between cities. Admissions of rotavirus diarrhoea peaked in winter and spring and were lowest in summer. Higher temperature and humidity in the previous week were associated with a decrease in rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions in three cities. The effects of both temperature and humidity on rotavirus admissions in Brisbane differed across seasons. Strategies to combat outbreaks of rotavirus diarrhoea should take climatic factors and seasonal effects into consideration to plan for the excess seasonal hospital admissions.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nHospitalizations for infectious diarrhoea comprise 2–4% of admissions in children aged <5 years in Australia [1]. Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea and one of the major causes of severe gastroenteritis in very young children [2–7]. Many studies have shown that at least 30–60% of hospital admissions for acute gastroenteritis in young children are the result of rotavirus infection [2–11]. The rate of rotavirus diarrhoeal admission in children aged <5 years is in the range of 1.3/1000 in Canada [12] to 7.5/1000 children in Australia, and even higher in children aged <2 years (11.5/1000) [2]. An estimated 10,000 hospital admissions occur annually in Australia for laboratory-confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis [2] and there are likely to be many more hospitalizations due to rotavirus that are coded as unidentified organisms. The direct cost of hospital care is estimated to be at least $Aus12 million and may be as high as $Aus15–18 million per annum [2].\\n\\nRotavirus infection has a distinctive cyclical pattern with sharp peaks occurring in mid to late winter, which is unique to rotavirus among all known major pathogens associated with gastroenteritis [2, 8, 13, 14]. Rotavirus has been called the ‘democratic virus’ because a large proportion of children in the world are infected during the first few years of life, whether they are rich or poor or live in temperate or tropical areas [13].\\n\\nRotavirus can remain viable outside the human body from several hours to several months, depending on the environment. The ideal environment for its survival consists of low temperature (4–20 °C); low...\\n\\n* Author for correspondence: Dr R. M.

Evidence suggests a seasonal pattern of rotavirus infections related to climatic factors, with cold and dry weather correlating with increased hospital admissions for rotavirus gastroenteritis.\\n\\nIndoor relative humidity and monthly rainfall have been speculated as significant environmental determinants of rotavirus infectivity. Studies indicate that rotavirus infections are more prevalent during the dry season in various countries, including those in Africa and South Asia.\\n\\nThis paper aims to investigate the seasonal variation of pediatric rotavirus diarrheal hospital admissions in three Australian cities and quantify the relationship with temperature and humidity.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nThe study was conducted in Brisbane, Canberra, and Melbourne, utilizing data on daily admissions of rotavirus diarrhoea in children aged 0–5 years from 1993 to 2003. Daily temperature and relative humidity data were obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology.\\n\\nData were aggregated to weekly counts for analysis, adjusting for population size differences using census data from 1996 and 2001.\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns\\n\\nTo examine seasonal patterns, average weekly temperature, relative humidity, and weekly admissions of rotavirus diarrhoea were plotted over the 11-year observation period. Data were aggregated by week of the year to visualize trends.\\n\\n# Model for Testing Association\\n\\nThe analysis aimed to determine if recent temperature and humidity were predictors of rotavirus diarrhoea admissions. A log-linear regression model with negative binomial errors was fitted to account for over-dispersion in admission counts. Autocorrelation was addressed by including admissions from the previous three weeks as an autoregressive term.\\n\\n# Long-term Trends\\n\\nLong-term trends in admissions may be influenced by non-temperature-related factors such as population changes, variations in rotavirus infectivity, coding changes in hospital admissions, or shifts in diarrheal management strategies over time.\\n---\\n# Effects of Temperature and Humidity on Rotavirus Diarrhoeal Admissions\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Effects of Temperature and Humidity on Rotavirus Diarrhoeal Admissions in Three Cities\\n\\nThis research investigates the impact of temperature and humidity on rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions across three cities, utilizing a log-linear regression model to analyze the data collected over an 11-year period.\\n\\n# Model Specification\\n\\nThe model used to analyze the weekly admission count is specified as follows:\\n\\nweekly admission count = (population size) * exp[a + a1 * time + a2 * time^2 + a3 * time^3 + b * (previous 3 weeks’ admissions)]\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\n- time = week (1, 2, …, 572)\\n- temp1 = mean temperature of the previous week\\n- humd1 = mean humidity of the previous week\\n- season = categorical variable indicating each of the four seasons\\n\\nThe population size term was accommodated by declaring the offset to be log(population size of children aged <5 years), allowing for comparisons across cities of different sizes.\\n\\n# Seasonal Effects and Temperature Effects\\n\\nLog-linear models were fitted to the data from each city separately.

Weekly number of rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions in children aged <5 years. (a) Mean weekly temperature (°C) and (b) mean weekly humidity (%) for three Australian cities, averaged for each week over 1993–2003.\\n\\nAdmissions peaked in week 31 in Brisbane, week 34 in Melbourne, and week 36 in Canberra. The increase in the number of rotavirus admissions between the seasonal low to high ranged from 157% to 310% in the three cities and was most marked in Canberra.\\n\\nIn each city, as the temperature approaches the winter low point, the number of rotavirus admissions starts to rise. The increase in admissions continues through the coldest months and into spring when temperatures are rising. In mid-spring, the number of admissions suddenly starts to decline while temperatures continue to rise. Admissions reach a very low level in summer and throughout autumn. Humidity climbs slowly from summer into autumn. At peak humidity, just before winter, the admissions start to rise and continue to rise throughout winter while humidity continues to fall throughout winter and spring. The peak in rotavirus admissions occurs a number of weeks after humidity starts to decrease in all three cities.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nWhen Model 2 was fitted, an increase in the mean temperature of the previous week and an increase in the mean relative humidity were both statistically significantly associated with a decrease in the number of admissions of rotavirus diarrhoea (Table 2). The negative coefficient of temperature for rotavirus diarrhoea was largest in Canberra (B = -0.05, P < 0.05). Relative humidity had the same effect in Canberra and Brisbane (B = -0.02, P < 0.05). For a unit rise in the temperature the week before, there was a 5% decline in rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions in Canberra, 3% in Brisbane, and 2% in Melbourne in the current week. An increase of 1% in relative humidity of the previous week was associated with a 2% decline in rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions in Canberra and Brisbane.\\n---\\n# Climatic Factors and Rotavirus Hospital Admissions\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #000;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.note {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: gray;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Climatic Factors and Rotavirus Hospital Admissions\\n\\n# Table 2.

M. D’Souza, G. Hall, and N. G. Becker\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the seasonal patterns of rotavirus admissions in children under 5 years of age across three Australian cities: Brisbane, Melbourne, and Canberra. The findings indicate significant correlations between climatic factors and rotavirus admissions.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is a leading cause of severe diarrheal disease in children worldwide. Understanding the seasonal patterns of rotavirus admissions can help in planning public health interventions.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe overall seasonal pattern of rotavirus admissions in children aged <5 years observed in this study is consistent with seasonal patterns found elsewhere [2, 8, 13, 14]. Rotavirus admissions peaked in winter in Brisbane and Melbourne and in early spring in Canberra. The onset of cool and dry weather is associated with a sharp increase in rotavirus diarrheal admissions as temperature and humidity fall but then suddenly decline in mid-spring.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe decline in admissions may be due to a decrease in the number of susceptible children in all three cities. A similar finding has also been seen among infants of Apache Indians living on desert reservations who experienced brief sharp outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis soon after the onset of cool weather [28]. In northern Japan, rotavirus infection was found to appear abruptly when the mean temperature of any 10-day period became <5 °C, reached a peak when it was <0 °C, and waned when it became >20 °C [18].\\n\\nThe regularity of onset of increased rotavirus illness at about week 22, and the rise up to week 36 followed by a rapid decline, suggests ‘triggers’ that start the epidemic and end it. The timing is similar in two cities that have very different baseline climates, and the absolute temperatures at the start of the rise and fall vary. Superimposed on this, temperature and humidity have an effect.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis is the first study to quantify an association between rotavirus hospital admissions in children aged <5 years and climatic factors. The time-series analysis showed that the risk of rotavirus diarrheal admissions had statistically significant negative relationships with average temperature and relative humidity of the previous week in all three cities when controlling for season. The effect of temperature and humidity on rotavirus diarrheal admissions varied significantly in different seasons.\\n\\nFig. 4.

Rotavirus cannot replicate outside the human body, and animals are not normally involved in the transmission cycle. Rotavirus is transmitted from person to person via the faecal–oral route [29], but more recently it has been recognized that it can be aerosolized [30], and the respiratory route has been implicated as a possible mode of transmission in humans [13]. The epidemiology of rotavirus, with its increased incidence in the cooler months in both temperate and tropical climates in developed and developing countries, resembles childhood viruses like measles that are spread by the respiratory route [13]. This might explain the winter seasonal peaks when respiratory infections also peak [31]. In Washington, DC, the isolation of rotavirus in laboratories occurred with clockwork-like precision of the annual cycle, more so than other paediatric viruses, respiratory syncytial virus [32, 33], influenza A and B viruses [34], and the respiratory adenoviruses [31].\\n\\nBehaviour changes with season, and people might spend more time indoors in cooler weather. Climatic factors may help in the survival and transmission of the rotavirus between human hosts. Along with this, we might have a change in behaviour, such as people coming into closer contact with each other and thereby increasing the chance of person-to-person transmission. This can only be resolved in studies of households. The start of the rise in hospital admissions may also be due to host factors like lowered immunity or increased susceptibility in the colder months compared to warmer months.\\n\\nIt is possible that differences in rates of hospital admission for rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions reflect variations in patterns of primary care influencing the number of children who present to hospital emergency departments and/or differences in hospital admission policies, or might be due to variations in classification of discharge diagnosis of children admitted with acute gastroenteritis [3].\\n\\nThis study has some limitations, as there may be some selection bias in using hospital admissions as people might differ significantly from those cases in the community. There may be a link with severity of disease and factors associated with weather. We were not able to control for housing, dietary habits, socio-economic status, recent contact with other cases, indoor temperature, and indoor relative humidity.\\n\\nThe predictable nature of excess rotavirus diarrhoeal admissions in winter and spring, together with an understanding of the links between climatic factors and rotavirus diarrhoeal disease, have the potential to predict demands on health service. If we know that there is a lag of at least 1 week between low temperatures and humidity and an increase in admissions, it could facilitate the appropriate reallocation of hospital staff and beds to prepare for seasonal fluctuations in cases, particularly as most or all of these admissions are emergency admissions and therefore unplanned.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank the Information Management Unit of ACT Health, Victorian Health Department, and Health Information Branch, Queensland Health for providing the hospitalization data.

This paper examined the relationship between notifications of cryptosporidiosis and temperature in metropolitan and rural areas of Victoria, Australia between 2001 and 2009. A negative binomial regression model was used to analyse monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall and the monthly count of cryptosporidiosis notifications. In the metropolitan area, a 1°C increase in monthly average minimum temperature of the current month was associated with a 22% increase in cryptosporidiosis notifications (incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.31). In the rural area, a 1°C increase in monthly average minimum temperature, lagged by 3 months, was associated with a 9% decrease in cryptosporidiosis notifications (IRR 0.91; 95% CI 0.86–0.97). Rainfall was not associated with notifications in either area. These relationships should be considered when planning public health response to ecological risks as well as when developing policies involving climate change. Rising ambient temperature may be an early warning signal for intensifying prevention efforts, including appropriate education for pool users about cryptosporidiosis infection and management, which might become more important as temperatures are projected to increase as a result of climate change.\\n\\nKey words: climate change, cryptosporidiosis, gastroenteritis, rainfall, temperature\\n\\n# Authors\\n\\nLillian Kent (corresponding author)\\n\\nLifestyle Research Centre,\\n\\nAvondale College of Higher Education,\\n\\nCooranbong,\\n\\nNew South Wales,\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\nE-mail: Lillian.kent@avondale.edu.au\\n\\nMichelle McPherson\\n\\nWestern Pacific Region Office,\\n\\nWorld Health Organization,\\n\\nManila,\\n\\nPhilippines\\n\\nNasra Higgins\\n\\nCommunicable Disease Prevention and Control Unit,\\n\\nVictorian Government Department of Health,\\n\\nMelbourne,\\n\\nVictoria,\\n\\nAustralia\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nClimate is one of many factors that can affect the transmission of micro-organisms, with outbreaks occurring both interannually and seasonally (or other calendar periods), for many infectious diseases. Rainfall or ambient temperature has been implicated in outbreaks of cholera, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Giardia spp., Shigella spp., typhoid, cryptosporidiosis, leptospirosis and a number of viruses. There is now substantial evidence that the world is experiencing accelerated climate change, with evident increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level. While Eastern Australia has become significantly drier and North-Western Australia has become significantly wetter since 1950, Australia has experienced an average warming trend of 0.9°C over the last century. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has predicted that the average surface temperature will increase by 1.0–5.0°C by 2070.

Kent et al. | Journal of Water and Health | 13.4 | 2015\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThere is projected to be an increase in summer temperatures of 0.6–2 °C by 2030, up to 5 °C by 2070 (CSIRO 2007b). This has implications for future disease control, not only for Australia but globally, if warmer temperatures are associated with increases in infectious diseases such as cryptosporidiosis. Indeed, positive associations between food- and water-borne pathogens and temperature have been reported in the literature (D’Souza et al. 2004; Kovats et al. 2004; Naumova et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2007; Lake et al. 2008; Britton et al. 2010a).\\n\\nCryptosporidium spp., a parasite that is an important cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, has previously been associated with rainfall (Curriero et al. 2001; Diaz 2006). A large cryptosporidiosis outbreak that occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, in 1993 was preceded by heavy rains which affected drinking water filtration (Ford et al. 2009). Heavy rains and flooding have also been implicated in cryptosporidiosis outbreaks through the excessive demand placed on sewage water treatment plants (Lipp et al. 2002) and through contamination of recreational water by the washing of pathogens or nutrients into source waters (Fisman 2007). While the associations between temperature of the current or previous month and routine notifications of ‘food poisoning’, including salmonellosis have been reported (Bentham & Langford 1995; D’Souza et al. 2004; Britton et al. 2010a), there are conflicting results on the association between cryptosporidiosis, ambient temperature and rainfall (Lake et al. 2008; Britton et al. 2010b).\\n\\nIn Australia, increases in cryptosporidiosis tend to occur in the warmer months and over irregular cycles (DoHA 2011). In Victoria, large increases in cryptosporidiosis notifications were observed in 2006 and 2009; this interannual nature of cryptosporidiosis has been observed in other Australian jurisdictions (Kent et al. 2011). The aim of this study was to therefore determine whether there was an association between cryptosporidiosis notifications, temperature and rainfall in metropolitan and rural Victoria regions between 2001 and 2009.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nCryptosporidiosis notifications for Victoria for the period 2001–2009 were obtained from the Victorian Department of Health Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance System. Notification data tend to underestimate the incidence of disease due to under-reporting of cases (Britton et al. 2010a); however, the association between cryptosporidiosis and weather should be unaffected as it is unlikely that these variables are correlated.\\n\\nFor a case to be confirmed, laboratory definitive evidence is required, the criterion of which is the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. To analyse the data by date of infection, the calculated onset date for each notification was adjusted by the average incubation period of cryptosporidiosis, which is 7 days.\\n\\nVictoria is the most southern state in mainland Australia and the smallest, making up approximately 227,000 km² (GA 2010). Victoria’s main city, Melbourne, is a large metropolitan area covering approximately 10,000 km² and surrounded by largely rural area (CM 2013). It is the second most populous city in Australia, with a population of 4.25 million people (ABS 2013a). Two areas within Victoria were analysed, Eastern Metropolitan Region (one of the five Melbourne metropolitan regions) and a rural region, Gippsland, herein referred to as ‘Metro’ and ‘Rural’. The ‘Metro’ area is Melbourne’s second largest metropolitan region in terms of population, extending from Melbourne’s inner eastern suburbs to outer eastern semi-rural mountainous areas and covering an area of approximately 3,000 km² (DEECD 2012). The ‘Rural’ area is even larger, covering 43,000 km² (DEPI 2014), with considerable variation in rainfall: from an approximate annual mean average of 600 mm (24 in) in the central plains to 1,800 mm (71 in) in the mountains (BOM 2014). These were chosen as they had the highest notification rate of all metropolitan and rural regions (Kent et al. 2011).\\n\\nMean monthly maximum and minimum temperature and mean monthly rainfall data were obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM 2012) using weather station data for Dunns Hill (latitude 37.88 S and longitude 145.34 E) and East Sale airport (latitude 38.12 S and longitude 147.13 E), to represent the weather patterns of ‘Metro’ and ‘Rural’, respectively.\\n\\nTo allow for overdispersion in the data, negative binomial regression was used for model fitting, using incident rate ratio (IRR).

These findings are supported by research from New Zealand, Australia, and the USA, which found temporal associations between increases in temperature and cryptosporidiosis notifications (Hu et al. 2007; Naumova et al. 2007; Lake et al. 2008).\\n\\nIn general, increased temperatures may provide the optimal conditions for pathogen survival, virulence, and replication, particularly when ambient overnight temperatures are warmer (Fisman 2007). In particular, Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts can persist in the environment and can be readily dispersed throughout the environment through increased rainfall events (King & Monis 2007). However, the oocysts are highly susceptible to inactivation with higher (>15 °C) environmental temperatures. Therefore, the observed relation between mean maximum and minimum temperatures and cryptosporidiosis in the metropolitan area may not be due to pathogen survival, virulence, and replication, as overnight temperatures may exceed this level and day temperatures certainly would. The relationship is more likely to be explained by human behaviour as recreational water activity, camping, and hiking are more common in the warmer months (Britton et al. 2010a). Certainly, cryptosporidiosis infection has been implicated in the use of swimming pools which may be more accessible in urban areas (Peuch et al. 2001; CDC 2007, 2009; Shields et al. 2008). However, this study also highlights the differential effect of temperature on notifications in metropolitan versus rural areas and would suggest that differing transmission modes may be at play.\\n\\nThe relationship between cryptosporidiosis and temperature was reversed for the rural area. The negative association between cryptosporidiosis notifications and temperature increased as the period of warmer temperatures was prolonged, with negligible difference in risk between mean maximum and minimum temperature. This finding is supported by a New Zealand study, which found that a 1 °C increase in current average temperature was associated with a 2% decrease in notifications (Britton et al. 2010b). This effect is comparable to the non-significant effect of unlagged temperatures on notifications in the present study. In the Victorian rural area, an increase in cryptosporidiosis notifications is seen in spring, which is a time of increased agriculture and livestock husbandry (Kent et al. 2011). In New Zealand, peak notifications also occur in the spring, and are associated with increased exposure to livestock (Lake et al. 2008). It would appear that cryptosporidiosis notifications are environmental exposures rather than behavioural activities as in urban areas.\\n\\nThe present study also found the associations were stronger for temperature in the current and 2 months prior.\\n---\\n# Cryptosporidiosis Associations with Ambient Temperature\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\nbackground-color: #f9f9f9;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh2 {\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.citation {\\nfont-style: italic;\\ncolor: #777;\\n}\\n\\n# Cryptosporidiosis Associations with Ambient Temperature\\n\\n# Authors: L. Kent et al.\\n\\nJournal of Water and Health | Volume 13, Issue 4 | 2015\\n\\nTo infection compared with the previous month or 3 months prior. Lake et al. (2008) found that the cryptosporidiosis rate in New Zealand was positively associated with temperatures in the current or previous month, rather than lags of 2 or 3 months. In another study from Massachusetts, USA, cryptosporidiosis notifications peaked about 40 days after peaks in temperature (Naumova et al. 2007). Reasons for the temporal delay in these studies have been attributed to differences in transmission routes, amplification of infection from person-to-person spread, survival of pathogens in the environment at different times of the year, differences in incubation periods, disease manifestation and/or testing practices (Naumova et al. 2007). In the present study, the lag period is not likely to be the result of delays in reporting as illness onset time was recorded in the surveillance system.\\n\\nRainfall has been strongly associated with cryptosporidiosis in a number of studies (Curriero et al. 2001; Patz 2001; Rose et al. 2001; Britton et al. 2010b) where it has been suggested that a number of events have to occur simultaneously to result in an outbreak. These include contamination of source water, transport of contaminant to water intake, insufficient treatment and exposure to contaminant (Fisman 2007). For example, the 1993 Milwaukee outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred as a result of simultaneous adverse events: heavy rainfall and subsequent runoff, with an inadequate coagulation-filtration process (Rose et al. 2001). The present study did not find an association between cryptosporidiosis and rainfall in any area examined. A New Zealand study using national level data also did not find an association between rainfall and cryptosporidiosis (Lake et al. 2008), while another New Zealand study, which used smaller census area units (Britton et al. 2010b), found a positive association. Analysis of larger areas does not take into account geographic variations in climate. The ‘Metro’ area examined in this study is a large area of approximately 3,000 km2. Rainfall associations may be found in Victorian studies if smaller areas were examined or if the adverse events described above were to occur simultaneously.\\n\\nThe increasing long-term trend for cryptosporidiosis notifications could also be explained by the fact that the Victorian population increased by an estimated 582,430 people between 2001 and 2009 (ABS 2013b). This equates to a 12.3% increase in population, the majority of which occurred in Victoria’s capital, Melbourne. However, this study found a 15% increase in cryptosporidiosis notifications in the ‘Metro’ area over this time. Changes in notification practices over time could also have influenced this trend. The large number of notifications found in 2001 may be because cryptosporidiosis became notifiable in that year. Furthermore, the authors are not aware of changes in notification practices and testing procedures since cryptosporidiosis became notifiable. Changes in swimming pool use, namely, changes in installations of private swimming pools and in the use of public pools over the period of this study may also have contributed to the trend of increasing notifications over the period of the study. However, the authors were not able to find any statistics on this for Victoria. Future studies which explore the temperature-notification trend of notifiable diseases need to gather information on behaviour that may be associated with temperature and risk of infection. Nevertheless, the minimum temperatures for Victoria between 2000 and 2010 were, on average, 0.2 °C warmer than for any other decade since 1910 (DSE 2012).'),\n",

It has been estimated that about 10% of people with gastroenteritis visit a doctor and then only 10% will have a stool specimen taken (Padiglione & Fairley 1998). Therefore, the sample used may not represent all cases of cryptosporidiosis in Victoria, but rather the more severe cases. This also suggests that notifications may be misrepresented geographically, but by focusing on a smaller geographic area this may be reduced.\\n\\nUsing one weather station as the proxy for the weather in each area is a limitation of the study. Both the ‘Metro’ and ‘Rural’ areas are large and cover a wide range of topographies and so the weather data from one site provide only crude patterns. Although care was taken in selecting the weather station, this may not have been representative of weather patterns for all climate variables for that area. Selecting a weather station in a different site may have provided different findings.

Despite these limitations, the strengths of association in this analysis, the consistency of findings in this study and that of other studies, and plausible biological pathways suggest that ambient temperature is causally related to cryptosporidiosis notifications.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis study also highlights the differential association between temperature and cryptosporidiosis notifications in metropolitan and rural areas, which may be explained by differences in transmission pathways. In metropolitan areas, individuals are more likely to become infected in warm weather through person-to-person contact such as in water recreational activities; in rural areas, infections in cooler weather are more likely to occur through contact with livestock.\\n\\n# Findings\\n\\nThe positive relationship between temperature and cryptosporidiosis notifications found in the metropolitan area has implications for the present and future. Although a review of climate and disease outbreaks conducted by the World Health Organization in 2004 did not identify cryptosporidiosis as a candidate for an early warning system (WHO 2004), this study has shown that higher average monthly minimum temperatures may be a warning to health authorities of a risk of cryptosporidiosis.\\n\\nStrategies to minimise cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in the event of prolonged increased temperatures could include monitoring of ambient temperatures in metropolitan areas in early summer as part of cryptosporidiosis surveillance and educating the public on the added risks of hot weather on recreational activities.\\n\\nIn addition, as cryptosporidiosis has often been associated with the use of public swimming pools in the USA, Australia and elsewhere, additional strategies include: educating users of the importance of hygiene; educating pool operators to adequately sanitise water/filters; clean up and water treatment after faecal accidents; restricting access of users/staff with diarrhoea; and educating users of their risks and responsibilities (Peuch et al. 2001; CDC 2007, 2009; Wheeler et al. 2007; Shields et al. 2008). As Cryptosporidium spp. is resistant to chlorine and can survive in swimming pools for a number of days, pool operators should be educated to install UV disinfection units following the filtration process to control the risk.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe future implications for the temperature–cryptosporidiosis relationship stem from the projections concerning global climate change. Given that climate models predict that the average temperature at the Earth’s surface could increase from 1.1 to 6.4 °C by the end of this century; the ongoing effects of climate change suggest increases in cryptosporidiosis notifications (IPCC 2007). Consequently, focusing specific strategies on warm weather-related activities during times of increasing temperatures could aid adaptation to the risk of cryptosporidiosis due to climate change.\\n\\n# References\\n\\nABS 2013a Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2011–2012.

These findings are discussed in relation to the epidemiology and prophylaxis of rotavirus infections.\\n\\n# Keywords\\n\\nRotavirus; Epidemiology; Seasonality; Relative humidity; Temperature; United Arab Emirates\\n\\n# 1. Introduction\\n\\nFollowing the discovery of rotavirus in the feces of calves suffering from diarrhea (Mebus et al., 1969), and in biopsy specimens of an infant's intestinal tissue (Bishop et al., 1973), it has been reported that rotaviruses are ubiquitous animal and human pathogens that cause significant diarrheal diseases in most mammalian and avian species (Flewett et al., 1974; Flewett and Babiuk, 1984; Estes and Cohen, 1989; Kapikian et al., 1974; Kapikian and Chanock, 1990; Middleton et al., 1974). More recently, rotaviruses have been shown to be involved in causing extra-intestinal infections in immunodeficient children (Gilger et al., 1992). They have been associated with enteritis particularly in young animals (under one month of age) and in infants (six months to two years). Epidemics of rotavirus among adults and the elderly have also been described (Hardy, 1987; Kapikian and Chanock, 1990). It has been estimated that over 500 million cases of diarrhea occur annually in humans, resulting either directly or indirectly in approximately 10 million deaths, of which approximately 1 million deaths have been attributed to rotaviruses (DeZoysa and Feachem, 1985; Ratalia, 1987). Despite their significant involvement in pediatric diarrhea, the role played by these viruses remained undetermined in human populations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The present project, therefore, was designed to define the role of rotaviruses in pediatric hospitalized diarrheal cases. This information has shed some light on the role of these viruses in acute viral enteritis in the local population. In addition, it defined the effect of seasonality on the prevalence of rotavirus in this part (Al-Ain) of the UAE.\\n\\n# 2. Materials and Methods\\n\\nStool samples were collected from the pediatric wards of hospitalized children suffering from diarrhea in the Al-Ain Medical District. The Al-Ain Medical District has three main hospitals serving a population of approximately two hundred thousand. Al-Ain Hospital serves mainly expatriates but UAE Nationals are also served here, and Tawam Hospital serves mainly UAE nationals but a limited number of expatriates.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Detection\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\n.results {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.figure {\\ntext-align: center;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.figure img {\\nmax-width: 100%;\\nheight: auto;\\n}\\n\\n# Detection of Rotavirus in Stool Samples\\n\\n# Authors: M.K.

Discussion\\n\\nRotaviruses remain an important pathogen inducing diarrhea in infants and young children in both developed and developing countries of the world. In Al-Ain, the population is mixed, i.e., locals and expatriates representing the Middle East, South East Asia, the Subcontinent, North America, Australia, and Europe. Therefore, the presence of rotavirus in the Al-Ain population was not a surprise.\\n\\nRotavirus was detected in all age groups under study and predominately in the 7-12 months age group. It was interesting to note that rotavirus was also recovered in the group of less than 3 months of age. This agreed with the age incidence observed in Nigerian (Oyejide and Fagbami, 1988) and Mexican children (Velazquez et al., 1993). The increasing incidence of rotavirus in children after the age of 6 months coincided with the age weaning usually begins and with the age at which maternally derived antibodies start to decline.\\n\\nRotavirus has been reported in adults and the elderly (Bourgeois et al., 1993; Hrdy, 1987; Pryor et al., 1987). In the present study, we also observed rotavirus in older children (> 10 years). The importance of rotavirus in this age group and in adults needs further investigation.\\n\\nThe role of seasonality in rotavirus dissemination is poorly understood. In our study, rotavirus was detected throughout the year, with its predominance during the months with low relative humidity (RH), no rainfall, and with relatively low temperature. Cook et al. (1990) have analyzed the data from 34 global studies to investigate the seasonal patterns of rotavirus gastroenteritis and considered their implications on the transmission of the virus. According to their report, the global pattern of rotavirus is quite distinct, with its predominance in the cooler months only in the Americas. In most of the world, the virus is present throughout the year, which suggests that a low level of transmission occurs all year round and that humans are a suitable reservoir.\\n\\nThe results of our study taken together with the findings of Cook et al. (1990) suggest that temperature alone does not account directly for this broad seasonal pattern and that other environmental factors like RH probably play a significant role in the dissemination of rotaviruses (Ansari et al., 1984; 1985a,b; 1987; Sattar and Ijaz, 1987).\\n\\nAl-Ain is located 150 km east of the capital city of Abu-Dhabi and is 400 meters above sea level. It is a traditional oasis with a climate ranging between a relatively cool, dry winter and a hot, dry summer. The percentage incidence of rotavirus infection during all the years of study revealed that it peaks in the months of March, April, May, October, November, and December. A comparison of meteorological data with rotavirus percentages throughout the year revealed a significant relationship of the monthly temperature, RH, and rainfall with rotavirus frequency. More rotavirus-positive cases occurred when there was low temperature, low RH, and no rainfall. Fewer cases occurred in the months with high temperature, RH, and rainfall.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our observations point towards an endemicity of rotavirus infection in the area studied. The infection was more frequent during the cooler, less humid months and in the periods of low rainfall. Further studies are indicated to extend this research.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Infections\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Infections\\n\\nRotavirus is a significant cause of enteritis across various age groups, particularly in regions with high humidity and temperature variations.

Zoonotic subtypes found in livestock may contribute to human disease occurrence through runoff of manure into multi-use surface water. This study investigated temporal associations among selected environmental variables and G. duodenalis occurrence in livestock reservoirs on human giardiasis incidence using data collected in the Waterloo Health Region, Ontario, Canada. The study objectives were to: (1) evaluate associations between human cases and environmental variables between 1 June 2006 and 31 December 2013, and (2) evaluate associations between human cases, environmental variables and livestock reservoirs using a subset of this time series, with both analyses controlling for seasonal and long-term trends. Human disease incidence exhibited a seasonal trend but no annual trend. A Poisson multivariable regression model identified an inverse association with water level lagged by 1 month (IRR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.01, 0.85, P < 0.05). Case crossover analysis found varying associations between lagged variables including livestock reservoirs (1 week), mean air temperature (3 weeks), river water level (1 week) and flow rate (1 week), and precipitation (4 weeks).

Many patients remain asymptomatic or are only transiently afflicted causing underreporting of the true prevalence.

Symptomatic cases may exhibit mild abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss; however, most infections are self-resolving.\\n\\nGiardia duodenalis (Gd) is composed of eight assemblages (A–H), which are genetic groupings with varying degrees of host-specific pathogenicity. Assemblages A and B primarily cause disease in humans (Yaoyu and Xiao 2011), but they also have zoonotic potential as they have been isolated from cattle, swine, dogs, cats, and some wild mammals (Caccio` and Ryan 2008; Farzan et al. 2011; Yaoyu and Xiao 2011). Assemblage types C–H have limited host ranges of domestic and wild animals, but rare occurrences in people have been reported (Yaoyu and Xiao 2011).\\n\\nZoonotic assemblages in livestock contribute to human disease through direct exposure or through manure-contaminated water sources used for recreation or drinking (Hunter and Thompson 2005; Farzan et al. 2011; Abdel-Moein and Saeed 2016). Ontario dairy cattle and pigs have been shown to harbor zoonotic subtypes of Gd (Coklin et al. 2007; Dixon et al. 2011; Farzan et al. 2011), and cysts shed in host feces are immediately infective in the environment. The low specific gravity of cysts, along with high precipitation, enhances transport from soil into water sources (Erickson and Ortega 2006; Wilkes et al. 2011).\\n\\nCysts are well adapted for wet and humid conditions, remaining infective in water with a temperature of 0–4 °C for 84 days (Yaoyu and Xiao 2011). Warmer air temperatures lead to increased recreational use of water sources by people, and hydrological characteristics of watersheds, such as water flow and level, can affect the suspension and sedimentation rate of cysts in surface waters (Erickson and Ortega 2006) facilitating Giardia cyst ingestion by people (Thomas et al. 2006; Peng et al. 2008).\\n\\nThe most common risk factors for human infection in Ontario include ingestion of contaminated water (e.g., drinking or recreational water), direct transmission via the fecal-oral route from infected people or animals, or consumption of contaminated food such as unwashed vegetables (Public Health Ontario 2017). Although outbreaks of giardiasis have been reported globally, they are uncommon in Ontario, with a recent descriptive study suggesting that 99% of Giardia cases are not linked epidemiologically (Keegan et al. 2009).\\n\\n# Seasonal Patterns and Environmental Associations\\n\\nThe seasonal pattern of human Giardia incidence has been reported with annual peaks in the late summer and early autumn (Addiss et al. 1992; Greig et al. 2001; Naumova et al. 2007; Keegan et al. 2009; Lal et al. 2012). This seasonal fluctuation, combined with the ability of Giardia to persist in the environment, is highly suggestive of a transmission cycle that is sensitive to climate and hydrological factors (Fisman 2007; Greer et al. 2008; Ng et al. 2008).\\n\\nTherefore, our a priori hypothesis is that environmental and hydrological conditions are associated with the occurrence of sporadic human Giardia cases within southern Ontario. Understanding associations between environment, livestock reservoirs, and human disease may enhance prevention and control strategies. In this respect, the use of a one health approach is appropriate for the study of Giardia to avoid simplifying complex relationships (Bouley et al. 2014).\\n\\nThe one health concept is a framework that recognizes the interconnectedness between the health of humans, animals, and the environment (Bouley et al. 2014). The objectives of this study were to identify temporal associations between environmental conditions, livestock Giardia reservoirs, and human giardiasis incidence using an integrated time series (2006–2013) from the Waterloo Health Region (WHR) in Ontario, Canada, and to compare the results obtained using two different methods that account for confounding due to seasonality and annual trends.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Sources of Data\\n\\n# Human Case Data\\n\\nThe Canadian province of Ontario is made up of 36 public health units, and all confirmed cases of Gd are reported to the provincial Integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). The WHR encompasses part of the multi-use Grand River watershed located in southwestern Ontario (Fig. 1). In 2011, the 1369 km2 region was densely populated with 507,096 people, 815 cattle farms, and 210 swine farms (Statistics Canada 2011).\\n\\nConfirmed cases of Gd are reported to iPHIS based on the finding of cysts or trophozoites in stool samples from patients with compatible clinical signs (after 2009, demonstration of Gd antigen by enzyme immunoassay or immunochromatographic test was also accepted in place of microscopy) (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care 2016). The case report date could be the date of symptom onset, the specimen submission date, the lab report date, or the date the case was reported to the data-\\n---\\n# The Influence of Climate and Livestock Reservoirs on Human Cases of Giardiasis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nfigure {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-style: italic;\\nmargin-top: 5px;\\n}\\n\\n# The Influence of Climate and Livestock Reservoirs on Human Cases of Giardiasis'),\n",

Therefore, every unique submitted case to iPHIS was used to maximize the study population. This study population is thought to be representative of the patients suffering impairment from disease. Cases who reported travel outside of the province of Ontario during the disease incubation period, or who could not confirm their travel history during the incubation period, were excluded. All cases in the dataset for the time series were identified as sporadic based on the provincial outbreak numbering system. Cases not identified by the local public health unit as being linked to an outbreak were considered to have occurred independently of other cases and coded with a unique identifier.\\n\\n# Climate and Hydrology Data\\n\\nThe WHR has a temperate climate consisting of distinct seasons made up of warm summers and cold winters with below freezing temperatures (Peel et al. 2007). Weather and hydrology observations for this region were measured daily over the study period from 1 June 2006 to 31 December 2013. The environmental variables included mean air temperature (°C) and total precipitation (mm), river water level (m) and river water flow rate (m3/s) (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2016a, b). Studies on the physical characteristics of Giardia have found that temperature is an important parameter influencing survival and recovery of viable cysts (Erickson and Ortega 2006). The focus of this study on waterborne transmission meant that precipitation, water flow and water level were variables.\\n---\\n# Research Paper\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.section {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Giardia Incidence and Environmental Factors\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nA. Brunn et al. conducted a study to evaluate the associations between human cases of Giardia and environmental variables. Weather data was recorded at the Region of Waterloo International Airport, Waterloo, Ontario, while daily water flow and water level observations were collected on the Grand River at Doon, Waterloo County, Ontario (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2016a, b).\\n\\n# Livestock Reservoir Data\\n\\nThe pilot site of the FoodNet sentinel surveillance program of the Public Health Agency of Canada operated in the WHR between 2005 and 2014. Farm level surveillance of livestock manure samples was conducted. Each month, one or more farm types (dairy, beef, or swine farm) were visited, and three fresh pooled manure samples and one pooled manure pit sample were collected (Public Health Agency of Canada 2010).\\n\\nEach fresh sample comprised manure from five animals, representing different ages, and the manure pit sample comprised up to five subsamples collected from different depths. Samples were tested by microscopy and PCR. At least one positive sample per farm per collection date underwent further molecular subtyping to determine the assemblage (Public Health Agency of Canada 2010).\\n\\nPCR and/or microscopy results for manure samples were recorded as positive, negative, or not done. A farm was labelled positive if at least one sample from the farm on a given collection date was positive for Giardia by PCR and/or microscopy. Numeric cyst counts were not performed. Aggregated counts of Giardia-positive farms per manure testing date were compiled to form a time series of positive livestock reservoirs in the region between 1 June 2006 and 31 December 2008.\\n\\n# Data Organization\\n\\nThe study was separated into two parts to reflect the two objectives: Objective I evaluated associations between human cases and environmental variables between 1 June 2006 and 31 December 2013. For Objective II, a subset of observations from Objective I collected between 1 June 2006 and 31 December 2008 were merged with the time series of Giardia-positive farms (livestock reservoir data) to create a dataset that integrated human, animal, and environmental data.\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\n# Seasonality\\n\\nSeasonal fluctuation of human Giardia incidence was assessed for statistical significance by linear combination of sine and cosine terms. We employed methods previously described by Ng et al. (2008) to use monthly sine and cosine variables to assess seasonality and a year term to evaluate annual trends:\\n\\nE(Y) = exp(a + b1 * year) + b2 * sin(2π * month/12) + b3 * cos(2π * month/12)\\n\\nwhere a is a constant, b is a regression coefficient for year or month, and E(Y) is the expected case count for a given month (Ng et al. 2008).\\n\\nAnnual variation and statistical significance of the seasonal smoothing terms were evaluated using a Poisson regression model with no predictor variables included. Significant smoothing terms (P < 0.05) were included in univariable analysis models of predictor variables; oscillating seasonal smoothers (sine and cosine terms) and the year variable were forced into all multivariable models to adjust for the expected confounding effects of seasonal and annual trends.\\n\\n# Multivariable Regression Models\\n\\nFor each objective, Poisson regression analysis was used to examine temporal associations among average monthly weather conditions (temperature and precipitation), hydrological conditions (river flow and level), and monthly aggregated Giardia-positive farms (Objective II) on monthly aggregated human case counts. Canadian census information provided the total annual population at risk to determine the incidence rate ratio of giardiasis in people in WHR.\\n\\nA 1-month lag period for environmental and livestock reservoir variables was chosen as it included the incubation period of Giardia in humans (approximately 7–14 days) as well as time for the pathogen to move from livestock and the environment into the human population. Correlation between predictor variables was assessed (cut-point > 0.8) and highly correlated pairs of variables reduced by eliminating one of the variables from further analysis. After univariable analysis (adjusted for statistically significant seasonal smoothers), monthly averaged environmental variables and monthly aggregated Giardia-positive farms that had incidence rate ratios (IRRs) that met a...\\n---\\n# The Influence of Climate and Livestock Reservoirs on Human Cases of Giardiasis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 2em;\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 1.5em;\\nmargin-top: 30px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 1.2em;\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin-bottom: 15px;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# The Influence of Climate and Livestock Reservoirs on Human Cases of Giardiasis\\n\\n# Statistical Analysis\\n\\nLiberal P value (P < 0.2) were brought forward into a multivariable Poisson regression model and a backward selection process was used to determine the final multivariable model (P < 0.05).

Scatter plots of predicted outcomes and Anscombe residuals were created to assess outliers and covariate patterns with high influence on the model.\\n\\n# Case Crossover Models\\n\\nA case crossover design was used to assess the impact of acute environmental and livestock exposures on daily human case counts. This approach is useful for rare diseases with a short incubation period and intermittent exposures that create different risk periods through which subjects pass temporally (Maclure 1991; Levy et al. 2001; Ng et al. 2008). The self-matching, case crossover design compares the exposure status immediately before a case occurs to the self-matched exposure status during a control period which is randomly selected to occur prior to, after, or spanning the hazard period (Levy et al. 2001). A time-stratified, 4:1 matched design was used to match four control periods by day of week to the case report date within each 4-week stratum. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess statistical associations between same week and 1–4-week-lagged exposures and daily human case counts. Environmental variables were ranked from lowest to highest within each stratum to further elucidate which exposure most contributed to risk of human case development. A distributed lag model was used to account for transmission of the pathogen through the environment and the average incubation period in humans.\\n\\nCase crossover associations were measured as odds ratios (OR). Statistically significant associations between human cases and exposures reported during the concurrent week (i.e. exposures with no lag period) were not considered to be biologically feasible, given the mean incubation period for Giardia in people is 7–14 days. All statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 14.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX).\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Objective I: Environmental Variables and Human Case Counts: 2006–2013\\n\\nBetween 1 June 2006 and December 31st there were 403 cases of giardiasis reported to iPHIS by the WHR. A reported symptom onset date was included for 304 (75%) of the cases. The average annual rate of reported cases was 10.8 cases per 100,000 person-years. Monthly human case counts showed a late summer and early autumn peak. High correlation (> 0.8) between water level and water flow meant that only water level was examined in multivariable regression analysis.\\n\\nA statistically significant seasonal pattern indicated increased human case occurrence coinciding with the late summer and early autumn period (P value for linear combination of sine and cosine seasonal estimators = 0.01). No annual trends were identified (P > 0.05).\\n\\n# Poisson Regression Analysis\\n\\nUnivariable regression analysis found that human disease incidence was inversely associated with water level of the previous month only (IRR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.18, 1.00, P = 0.05). When this environmental exposure was applied to the main effects model adjusted for seasonal predictors and year, it was not statistically significant (P = 0.06).\\n\\n# Case Crossover Analysis\\n\\nCase crossover analysis found that the water level and flow rate of the Grand River 1 week prior to human cases was associated with an increased risk of giardiasis in the WHR. Within-stratum coolest mean air temperatures (lowest tertile) increased the odds of human case occurrence 3 weeks later (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60, 0.94, P = 0.014).\\n\\n# Objective 2: Environmental Variables, Livestock Reservoirs and Human Case Counts, 2006–2008\\n\\nBetween 1 June 2006 to 31 December 2008, 145 human cases were reported to iPHIS for the WHR representing an average rate of 11.6 cases per 100,000 person-years. There were 107 (73%) recorded cases with a reported date of symptom onset. Between 1 June 2006 and 31 December 2008, 335 manure samples were collected from 86 unique cattle and swine farms. 222 (66%) manure samples tested positive by either microscopy or PCR, or both. Assemblage typing data was restricted to 128 positive samples and identified 30 (23%) samples as assemblages A or B, the remaining samples were typed as assemblage E.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Giardia duodenalis Cases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Giardia duodenalis Cases\\n\\nFigure 2.

A univariable model using the number of Giardia-positive farms as the predictor found that Giardia-positive farms were not associated with human cases (P > 0.05). The final multivariable model controlling for seasonality and year found statistically significant associations with water level and 1-month-lagged water level (IRR = 9.80, 95% CI 1.69, 56.71, P = 0.01; IRR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.01, 0.85, P = 0.04) (Table 2).\\n\\n# Case Crossover Analysis\\n\\nCase crossover analysis of the truncated time series that included data on livestock reservoirs found associations between mean temperature and increased odds of human cases occurring 3 weeks later (Table 2), whereas decreases in temperature (lowest tertile) for the same lag period reduced the risk of infection (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05, 2.38, P = 0.029; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38, 0.83, P = 0.004). Livestock reservoirs lagged by one week increased human giardiasis risk (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.23, 2.22, P = 0.001) (Fig. 3). Increasing levels of precipitation decreased the odds of an individual becoming a case 4 weeks later (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.37, 0.97, P = 0.038) (Table 2).\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThis study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between environmental factors, livestock pathogen reservoirs, and the risk of human giardiasis.

Case crossover results evaluating associations between the presence of weekly aggregated livestock reservoirs of G. duodenalis and human cases of Giardia duodenalis in the Waterloo health region, Ontario, 2006–2008. The hazard period is a 4-week period preceding a human case during which weekly aggregated exposures are assessed for influence on the odds of a human case occurring on day 0 (far right of the x-axis). Solid line = weekly odds ratio, dashed lines = upper and lower 95% confidence limits, * = statistically significant odds ratio (P < 0.05), grey shaded box = time within the hazard period that precedes a human case with a statistically significant exposure.\\n\\nBorne pathogen (Yaoyu and Xiao 2011), suggests human giardiasis is sensitive to climate and hydrology factors. Associations between human case occurrence and hydrological variables were identified in both the multivariable and case crossover analysis. Inverse associations between aggregated human case counts and river water levels have been previously reported for another water-borne pathogen, Legionella, in multivariable models (Ng et al. 2008). In contrast to the findings of our multivariable model, the case crossover analysis found that the odds of human cases increased with the water level and flow of the Grand River occurring 1 week before cases. These findings differ from a case crossover study on the enteric protozoa, Cryptosporidium, which identified increased water flow and water levels as having a protective effect on human case risk and attributed this to dilution of pathogen concentrations in the watershed (Brankston et al. 2018).\\n\\nThe discrepancy between these results may be related to external control of river flow and level exercised by the Grand River Conservation Authority via a system of dams and water reservoirs which minimize flooding risk and maintain water quality for discharging sewage plants. The Grand River at Doon, Ontario, where hydrology data for this study was collected, is heavily augmented during the late summer dry period. Up to 90% of the total river water volume at Doon in August can come from the reservoir (Grand River Conservation Authority 2014). While the effects of river level manipulation may be lost in monthly averaged exposure data, reservoir release seen as an acute exposure could influence associations being found with human case counts using the case crossover methodology. Alternately, resuspension of enteric pathogens from stream sediments during periods of high water flow, such as stormy weather, has been proposed as an explanation for measurements of increased concentrations of E. coli occurring with high stream flow rates (Dorner et al. 2006).\\n\\nWhile an explanatory hypothesis for a positive association between human giardiasis cases and water levels and flow rates in relation to increased river cyst concentration is unclear in the present study, cyst survival in river sediments and potential for resuspension is an area for future research. When the presence of livestock reservoirs was added to the model (Objective 2), an increase in the odds of human cases was seen with a 1-week lag period. Surveillance studies have confirmed the presence of zoonotic Giardia assemblages in Ontario cattle and swine herds (Coklin et al. 2007; Dixon et al. 2011; Farzan et al. 2011), providing initial support for the hypothesis of spill-over of zoonotic Gd from livestock reservoirs.\\n\\nOur results would benefit from molecular typing of Giardia cysts obtained from the Grand River to confirm if potentially zoonotic cysts from livestock can survive effluent transport mechanisms into the watershed. Statistically significant associations between mean temperature and human case incidence from the case crossover analysis resulted in inverse effects at the lowest tertile of mean temperature with a lag period of 3 weeks. In both the full and truncated time series, the lowest mean air temperatures occurring three weeks prior to human cases decreased the risk of giardiasis.\\n\\nPrevious studies have reported associations between time-lagged high temperatures and increased risk of waterborne enteric disease (Thomas et al. 2006; Naumova et al. 2007; Brankston et al. 2018), possibly reflecting changes in human behaviour and greater opportunities for exposure to contaminated surface waters (Thomas et al. 2006; Peng et al. 2008; Brankston et al. 2018). While the results found in this study do not directly support this hypothesis, it is possible that on days with cooler than average temperatures a protective effect is observed as people may be less inclined to recreate in natural water bodies.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Giardiasis and Environmental Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 2em;\\nmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 1.5em;\\nmargin-top: 1.5em;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 0.5em 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Giardiasis and Environmental Factors\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis study investigates the relationship between environmental factors and the occurrence of giardiasis in humans, focusing on the influence of precipitation and temperature on disease incidence.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nIn the truncated time series, within-stratum highest precipitation levels occurring 4 weeks prior to human cases were inversely related to giardiasis occurrence (Table 2). This result contradicts two studies that found that high rainfall events preceded increased human enteric case incidence (Thomas et al. 2006; Escobedo et al. 2015), however, one study was based in Cuba where average rainfall is higher than what is observed in Ontario (Escobedo et al. 2015). The second study, based in Canada, used a longer hazard period of 6 weeks and stratified precipitation to assess only extreme rainfall events (Thomas et al. 2006). The difference in results may be related to stratification choice, length of hazard period, or pathogen biology.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nSome limitations should be noted. Aggregating cases into monthly counts could mask underlying patterns. For example, environmental variables averaged by month may not reflect the true exposures influencing transmission, potentially leading to imprecise inferences. Case crossover analysis aims to avoid this potential bias by examining associations between acute exposures and daily case occurrence using a self-matched study design. However, the testing of multiple hypotheses in the case crossover method may increase the probability of a Type 1 error resulting in spurious associations. In this study, type 1 errors were minimized by grouping exposures to minimize the number of hypotheses tested.\\n\\nThe livestock sampling data for Gd was constrained by inconsistent monthly sampling and sporadic genotyping results, leading to assemblage type reporting for just over 50% of positive samples. We acknowledge that the Giardia-positive farm counts might not accurately reflect the true number of Giardia-positive farms in the region. Nonetheless, the positive counts taken from surveillance data represent a subset and likely underrepresent the true number of cases, influencing the bias towards the null. Assemblage typing data provided confirmation that potentially zoonotic Gd assemblages were present in livestock reservoirs in the region, supporting the possibility of a zoonotic transmission route. Molecular studies of isolates and genetic assemblage typing of samples would strengthen the spill-over hypothesis. Effect modification between positive-testing farms and environmental variables was not investigated due to limited farm data; however, including this as a future direction could contribute to our understanding of livestock disease reservoirs.\\n\\nSymptom onset dates were reported for 75% (Objective I dataset) and 73% (Objective II dataset) of human case counts used in this study. The remaining cases were included in the study to counteract underreporting which is known to occur; however, it is possible that the inclusion of these cases resulted in incorrect estimates of associations and exposure lag periods.'),\n",

The remaining cases were included in the study to counteract underreporting which is known to occur; however, it is possible that the inclusion of these cases resulted in incorrect estimates of associations and exposure lag periods.\\n\\nEcological systems are changing at an unprecedented rate (Walther et al. 2002; Post et al. 2009). With climatic conditions expected to change in the coming years, it is necessary to understand the environmental drivers of climate-sensitive diseases (Bouley et al. 2014; Machalaba et al. 2015). While the design of this study precludes conclusions being drawn regarding cause and effect, the relationships described provide an understanding of the associations between human giardiasis, livestock disease reservoirs, and environmental variables using a one health approach.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nSeasonality of human Gd cases appears to be influenced by hydrology and temperature variables occurring 1–3 weeks prior to case occurrence. Molecular epidemiology confirming survival of zoonotic pathogen spill-over from livestock into watersheds would assist in clarifying the influence of livestock reservoirs. The results of this study contribute information about the influence of environmental and livestock exposures on a climate-sensitive waterborne disease and may be useful in future forecasting of the effects of climate change on human enteric disease.\\n\\n# Acknowledgements\\n\\nWe thank Public Health Ontario, Public Health Agency of Canada and Environment and Climate Change Canada for providing access to the datasets required to undertake this study.\\n\\n# Funding\\n\\nThis study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Canada Research Chairs Program.\\n---\\n# The Influence of Climate and Livestock Reservoirs on Human Cases of Giardiasis\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n# The Influence of Climate and Livestock Reservoirs on Human Cases of Giardiasis\\n\\n# Compliance with Ethical Standards\\n\\n# Conflict of Interest\\n\\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\\n\\n# Ethical Standard\\n\\nThe de-identified human case data were retrieved from surveillance databases with no individual identifying information.

Here, we study the association of meteorologic factors with rotavirus activity, as determined by the number of children hospitalized for rotavirus gastroenteritis on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca (Spain). We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of children aged 0–5 years admitted for rotavirus gastroenteritis between January 2000 and December 2010. The number of rotavirus hospitalizations was correlated to temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, water vapor pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation using regression and time-series techniques. A total of 311 patients were hospitalized for rotavirus gastroenteritis in the 11-year study period, with a seasonal pattern from December to June, and a peak incidence in February. After multiple regressions, weekly rotavirus activity could be explained in 82 % of cases (p&lt;0.001) with a one-week lag meteorologic model. Rotavirus activity was negatively associated to temperature and positively associated to atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, and wind speed. Temperature and solar radiation were the factors that contributed most to the model, with a peak rotavirus activity at 9°C and 800 10KJ/m2.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRotavirus is the most common viral agent of acute diarrhea in children under 5 years of age worldwide. In temperate regions, rotavirus gastroenteritis is highly seasonal, and typically peaks during the late winter or early spring, with a 6 months difference between the peaks in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. By contrast, the seasonal pattern in the tropics is less defined, with cases detected all year round.\\n\\nObservational studies of the seasonality of rotavirus disease have suggested that, in temperate areas, lower temperature, lower relative humidity, and lower levels of rainfall are associated with increased risk of rotavirus infections. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the seasonality of rotavirus disease in the tropics concluded that higher numbers of rotavirus infections were found at colder and drier times of the year. These findings suggest an important contribution of meteoric factors in the increases and declines of rotavirus activity and has raised the interest to determine the factors involved. However, most studies to determine this association are based on simple correlations, which do not control for underlying trends and confounding factors. To determine the relationship between weather conditions and the occurrence of rotavirus gastroenteritis, it is necessary to apply multivariate regression models considering all the plausible variables, using time-series analysis when necessary. To date, only three studies have applied this methodology to a limited number of meteorologic factors, i.e., temperature, humidity, and rainfall. In an Australian study, lower temperatures and lower relative...\\n\\nCorrespondence to: D.

In Dhaka (Bangladesh), a high temperature, low humidity, and high river level increased the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis. In Great Britain and The Netherlands, the ambient temperature was inversely associated with changes in rotavirus transmission and disease, but there was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. More recently, in 2013, Patel et al. studied the global seasonality of rotavirus disease and suggested that the country income level is more predictive of seasonal disease than temperature and rainfall.\\n\\nThe meteorologic conditions are closely associated variables, and analysis of a small number of these factors cannot exclude false associations or establish the degree of association between the variables involved. Therefore, further studies considering the effects of a larger number of meteorologic factors are needed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the most relevant meteorologic factors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, water vapor pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation) with rotavirus activity as measured by the number of hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis. Multivariate regression models using these variables were tested to explain and/or predict the seasonality of rotavirus gastroenteritis in our area.\\n\\n# Materials and Methods\\n\\nThe study was conducted on the island of Mallorca (Spain), a temperate Mediterranean region with mild winters, hot summers, and moderate rainfalls. To measure the activity of rotavirus, we used the number of hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis in a hospital attending to a population of 330,000 inhabitants (20,790 < 5 years of age). From January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010, the medical records of infants aged 0–5 years admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of rotavirus gastroenteritis were retrospectively reviewed. Rotavirus was tested all year round in infants less than 5 years of age admitted for gastroenteritis. During the study period, fecal samples were collected and analyzed for rotavirus antigen using an immunochromatographic commercial kit (Biorapid Rota/Adeno, Biokit S.A., Barcelona, Spain).\\n\\n# Data Analyses\\n\\nDescriptive analysis was performed using frequency distributions or rates. All continuous variables were confirmed to be normally distributed, or to have skewness not significantly different from zero. The results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile (IQR), as required.\\n\\nRegression and time-series techniques were used to model the relationship between hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis and temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, water vapor pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation. The variables were paired throughout the 52 weeks of the year; the meteorologic data were the mean of the different weekly means, and rotavirus activity was the sum of admissions for rotavirus gastroenteritis during the weeks of the year. Collinearity between variables was studied by performing tolerance testing. Multivariate regression was then performed using backward elimination for variable selection.\\n\\nTo investigate the delayed effects of weather on the activity of rotavirus, lagged weather factors of one and more weeks were introduced in the models. After obtaining the best fitting model, this was tested for autocorrelation using the Breusch–Godfrey test for higher order serial correlation. To evaluate the contribution of each meteorologic variable on rotavirus activity, controlling the effect of the other meteorologic variables of the model, the square of the semi-partial correlation coefficient was obtained. Lastly, we determined the meteorologic values of maximum and minimum rotavirus activity. To include the meteorologic value closest to the time of viral transmission, we considered the incubation period (1–3 days) plus 48 h between the beginning of symptoms and admission. The mean meteorologic values during this period were considered the best approximation. To explore if the higher rate of rotavirus during certain meteorologic values was not only dependent on the frequency of this factor, we used the ratio between the number of admissions per meteorologic value and the number.\\n\\n# Meteorologic Data\\n\\nData on temperature, humidity, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, water vapor pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation were obtained from the Spanish Agency of Meteorology.

The median age was 6 months (IQR: 3–9 months) and there was a male sex predominance (183/311, 55.8 %). The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 3–8), and after correcting for age, no variation was observed during the study period. The average incidence of admissions for rotavirus gastroenteritis during the 11 years of study was 135.9 per 100,000 children <5 years of age per year. There were no differences in hospitalizations between the period 2007–2010 (postvaccine era) and earlier. A seasonal pattern was observed, with 94 % of admissions for rotavirus gastroenteritis occurring from December to June, with a peak incidence in February.\\n\\nFigure 1: Annual fluctuation in the climate parameters over the study period, 2000–2010\\n\\n# Meteorologic Factors and Rotavirus Gastroenteritis\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the annual fluctuation in the climate parameters during the study period. Admission for rotavirus gastroenteritis acquired a normal distribution after logarithmic transformation. Analysis was started with simple linear correlations, which are shown in Table 1. The studied variables presented a certain degree of association between them, but tolerance tests did not show collinearity. Multivariate regression was performed with different time lags. The strongest association between meteorologic factors and rotavirus gastroenteritis was observed using a one-week lag. After multiple regression analysis, weekly log rotavirus activity could be explained in 82 % (p<0.001) of cases with a one-week lag meteorologic model. This model showed an association of rotavirus activity with the mean temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and global solar radiation in the previous week. The mean temperature was the variable that contributed most to the model. The association was negative for temperature and positive for the rest of the variables.\\n\\n# Tables\\n\\n**Table 1: Simple linear correlations between log-transformed rotavirus admissions and meteorologic factors**\\n|Variables|Correlation Coefficients|\\n|---|---|\\n|Solar radiation|−0.42|\\n|Mean temperature|−0.82|\\n|Wind speed|0.1|\\n|Atmospheric pressure|0.47|\\n|Rainfall|−0.04|\\n|Water vapor pressure|−0.80|\\n|Relative humidity|0.46|\\n\\n**Table 2: Multiple regression analysis for log-transformed rotavirus activity and meteorologic factors**\\n|Independent Variables|Coefficients (SE)|p-Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Solar radiation|0.0007 (0.0002)|<0.0001|\\n|Mean temperature|−0.196 (0.02)|<0.0001|\\n|Wind speed|0.09 (0.038)|<0.05|\\n|Atmospheric pressure|0.168 (0.04)|<0.0001|\\n|Rainfall|-|-|\\n\\na Determination coefficient (R2)=0.82 (p<0.0001)\\n\\nb Equation constant −171\\n\\nc Standard error\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Activity and Meteorologic Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nth, td {\\nborder: 1px solid #bdc3c7;\\npadding: 8px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nth {\\nbackground-color: #ecf0f1;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\ntext-align: center;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Activity and Meteorologic Factors\\n\\n# Table 3: Square Semi-Partial Correlation for Log-Transformed Rotavirus Activity and Meteorologic Factors\\n\\n|Model Variables|Square Semi-Partial Correlation|p-Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Solar Radiation|0.09|&lt;0.0001|\\n|Mean Temperature|0.43|&lt;0.0001|\\n|Wind Speed|0.02|&lt;0.05|\\n|Atmospheric Pressure|0.06|&lt;0.001|\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nThe association of rotavirus activity with different meteorologic factors using multivariate analysis suggests the existence of a complex interaction among them. In this study, the strongest association was observed between rotavirus activity and some meteorologic conditions in the previous week. Our one-week lag model predicted 82% of log rotavirus activity with four variables, that is, mean temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and global solar radiation. Low temperature was the most important independent factor associated with rotavirus infection, with a peak activity at about 9°C, but no relation was observed with water vapor pressure, humidity levels, or rainfall. The inverse association between temperature and rotavirus activity is consistent with previous epidemiologic and experimental studies. Similar to that observed in Great Britain and The Netherlands, we found no relationship between rotavirus activity and humidity or rainfall.\\n\\nIn this study, we report for the first time a direct association of rotavirus activity with atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation. The best conditions for rotavirus infections in our model occurred with higher atmospheric pressure and lower temperature, as seen in the months of January and February. Viral activity increased with atmospheric pressure, with a peak occurring within 1,036 hPa. This finding could support an airborne transmission of rotavirus, a mechanism that has been previously suggested. However, the lack of experimental studies makes it difficult to explain this mechanism. The atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the air column. At high pressures, the air is compressed and the particles inside have less mobility. Therefore, the increase in the atmospheric pressure may result in a smaller dispersion of rotavirus-containing bioparticles, which could favor infectivity. On the contrary, high pressure could favor the settlement of airborne particles, thus limiting rotavirus airborne transmission. In addition, high atmospheric pressures reduce evaporation rates, retaining moisture around airborne rotavirus particles, which could increase the survival of the virus on surfaces.\\n\\nVariations in wind have been considered to be involved in rotavirus epidemics, as suggested by Purohit et al. with easterly wind in Pune (India). In our study, we observed that wind speed was an independent factor for rotavirus activity. Although the association was statistically significant, the impact of this factor on our model was very small (2%). In our setting, wind could help spread the infective particles through.\\n\\nFig. 3: Partial regression leverage plots for meteorologic factors and rotavirus admissions.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Activity and Meteorologic Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.chart {\\ndisplay: flex;\\njustify-content: space-around;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.chart div {\\nwidth: 30%;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus Activity and Meteorologic Factors\\n\\n# Abstract'),\n",

However, in developing countries, water contamination and dispersion of rotavirus could play a significant role. When simple regression analysis was performed, the association of solar radiation and rotavirus activity was found to be inverse. However, when multiple regression analysis was used, this association became positive. It is known that with crude statistical methods, coincidental occurrences may be incorrectly posited as causal. The use of multiple regression and time-series techniques provides a more accurate picture of the relationship between meteorologic factors and rotavirus activity.\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Rotavirus and Meteorologic Factors\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #2c3e50;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\n}\\n\\n# Influence of Meteorologic Factors on Rotavirus Activity\\n\\nFactors involved because they control for underlying trends and seasonal confounders. Solar radiation has been linked to the immune system and has been suggested either as an immunostimulatory factor or as an immunosuppressive factor. Sufficient data have been generated from animal models that indicate a suppression of viral immune responses induced by sunlight exposure. The immunosuppressive effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation are well known in some human viral infections, such as those caused by herpes simplex virus and human papillomavirus, in which UV radiation has a detrimental effect. Therefore, the systemic down-regulation in immunity caused by UV radiation can affect other viral infections.\\n\\nOne of the major effects of UV radiation is the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin. Vitamin D is also an immunomodulator and has immunostimulant and immunosuppressive actions. Vitamin D insufficiency has been related to the development of infections by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and other bacteria. However, vitamin D and UV-B stimulate Foxp3+ Tregs cells, producing IL-10, which has an immunosuppressive activity. In addition, experimental studies have shown that vitamin D decreases the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in a dose-dependent manner. NK cells are well known for their role in the innate defense against viral infections and have been suggested to play an important role in the protection and recovery of rotavirus infections. In fact, some reports have associated prolonged rotavirus shedding to impaired NK cells activity. Therefore, the association of rotavirus activity and solar radiation observed in our study would be an epidemiologic finding in agreement with the immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation and/or vitamin D.\\n\\nThe mature rotavirus particle (virion) is a triple-layered particle that is very resistant to physical inactivation, surviving for weeks on surfaces and in water. Rotavirus is transmitted by the fecal–oral route, directly from person to person, or by contaminated fomites. Although respiratory spread has been suspected, it appears more likely that infections result from airborne spread after aerosol formation of particles, e.g., from diapers or toilet flushing. The stability of rotaviruses in the environment at ambient temperatures may contribute to the efficiency of their transmission. Humans are the natural reservoir of rotavirus, where the virus replicates at low levels until a number of factors trigger the annual epidemic. The relationship between rotavirus transmission and outbreaks of disease probably depends on the combination of the contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals, the transmissibility of the virus, and host immunity. Moreover, the role of human behavior may be important in the development of epidemics, but is difficult to evaluate. In our study, we added the factor schooling as an independent variable in our model, but its impact was not statistically significant (p=0.6, data not shown).\\n\\nMeteorologic factors are considered to influence rotavirus disease by affecting transmission of the virus and its survival in the environment, but the pathways that lead to outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis are uncertain. In addition, the isolation of rotavirus in asymptomatic individuals occurs without any particular seasonality. As a consequence, there must be factors not related to viral transmission that favor the outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Meteorologic factors such as temperature or solar radiation might have a role in the increase of host susceptibility.\\n\\nThe results of this study were not skewed by the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in early 2007. In Spain, the rotavirus vaccine is not included in the national immunization program, and the estimated coverage among children less than 1 year old in our area was less than 10%, with no impact on hospitalization. The incidence of admission for rotavirus gastroenteritis (135.9/100,000/year) did not vary significantly during the study period and was in the range already reported from Spain.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, we present here a model to study the influence of weather conditions on the activity of rotavirus. To measure the activity of rotavirus, we used the number of hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis in a tertiary care hospital. Since rotavirus gastroenteritis is not notifiable in Spain and we cannot know the real number of rotavirus infections in our population, the use of the number of hospitalizations is a well-known method for assessing the activity of the virus. We have observed a strong association between rotavirus activity and mean temperature, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. The association of rotavirus activity with the latter three factors has not been previously reported. In our model, the correlation of rotavirus activity with atmospheric pressure and wind speed supports the role of airborne transmission of infective particles of rotavirus. We are aware of the limitations of this type of epidemiologic studies, where the indirect effects of weather on the lifestyle or the immunological status of the population are not considered. However, the value of this kind of approach cannot be overlooked, since it allowed us to predict more than 80% of hospitalizations for rotavirus infections.\\n\\n# Conflict of Interest\\n\\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n1.

In temperate climates, incidence is highly seasonal but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, making human disease control difficult. We hypothesised that observed disease patterns reflect complex interactions between weather, patterns of human risk behaviour, immune status and level of food contamination. Only by understanding these can we find effective interventions.\\n\\nMethods: We analysed trends in human Campylobacter cases in NE England from 2004 to 2009, investigating the associations between different risk factors and disease using time-series models. We then developed an individual-based (IB) model of risk behaviour, human immunological responses to infection and environmental contamination driven by weather and land use. We parameterised the IB model for NE England and compared outputs to observed numbers of reported cases each month in the population in 2004–2009. Finally, we used it to investigate different community level disease reduction strategies.\\n\\nResults: Risk behaviours like countryside visits (t = 3.665, P < 0.001 and t = − 2.187, P = 0.029 for temperature and rainfall respectively), and consumption of barbecued food were strongly associated with weather, (t = 3.219, P = 0.002 and t = 2.015, P = 0.045 for weekly average temperature and average maximum temperature respectively) and also rain (t = 2.254, P = 0.02527). This suggests that the effect of weather was indirect, acting through changes in risk behaviour. The seasonal pattern of cases predicted by the IB model was significantly related to observed patterns (r = 0.72, P < 0.001) indicating that simulating risk behaviour could produce the observed seasonal patterns of cases. A vaccination strategy providing short-term immunity was more effective than educational interventions to modify human risk behaviour. Extending immunity to 1 year from 20 days reduced disease burden by an order of magnitude (from 2412–2414 to 203–309 cases per 50,000 person-years).\\n\\nConclusions: This is the first interdisciplinary study to integrate environment, risk behaviour, socio-demographics and immunology to model Campylobacter infection, including pathways to mitigation. We conclude that vaccination is likely to be the best route for intervening against campylobacteriosis despite the technical problems associated.\\n\\nCorrespondence: roy.sanderson@newcastle.ac.uk\\n\\nModelling, Evidence and Policy Research Group, School of Natural and Environmental Science, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, UK\\n\\n© The Author(s) 2019.

Campylobacteriosis occurs in 1% of the US population each year [1] and costs the European Union alone an estimated €2.4 billion annually [2]. In developing countries, the disease is endemic but extensively unrecorded and is prevalent in infants (< 1 year), with isolation rates of 8 to 21% of all diarrhoea samples [3]. In developed countries, the disease also occurs in older age groups. There is considerable pressure to reduce disease burden, with government agencies having strategies to monitor disease. The public health burden, however, continues to rise. Illness is often associated with consumption of chicken [4–9], but this does not account for all cases [10]. In temperate regions, Campylobacter incidence is also predictably seasonal [10, 11], but the causes of this seasonality are not understood. Campylobacter is found in many animal species, and these, along with environmental exposures, have been suggested to explain 20–40% of disease burden [12]. The relative importance of different exposures to disease remains largely unquantified, which renders effective intervention to reduce the disease burden difficult. Furthermore, understanding of the interaction between human host and pathogen is poor, as seroconversion rates are variable (67–96%) and infections can be asymptomatic [13]. There is also a dose–response relationship for infection [14, 15], but not symptoms [16].\\n\\n# Why is the disease seasonal in developed countries?\\n\\nUnderstanding the causes of seasonality could help identify methods for mitigating against disease when it is most prevalent. Exposure to Campylobacter is multifactorial, in that the pathogen is probably ubiquitous in the environment and in much raw chicken. To understand how the disease spreads requires understanding of human risk behaviours, social demography; consideration of how contact with the pathogen comes about and how it leads to disease. In effect, we need to integrate across a range of ‘epidemiological’ processes that operate at different scales. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach to investigate different pathways of exposure to Campylobacter strains via the rural environment and diets, and link these to potential seasonality in human risk behaviours. We then attempt to determine the most effective interventions to mitigate disease. We used a combined biostatistical and individual-based (IB) modelling approach. We used time-series analyses to investigate the role of weather in disease and in mediating those human risk behaviours that increase exposure to the pathogen and hence disease. We sought to identify the extent to which disease is related to weather after adjusting for seasonality numerically for a real population where the disease burden was known. One issue with analysing data that show seasonality is that apparent associations may occur between two or more variables, but the correlation does not reflect a causal link between the variable as there is another (often unmeasured variable) driving both processes. We used harmonic regression to model the relationship between the pattern of cases and human risk behaviours and month. This approach allowed us to adjust for seasonality and identify the direct and indirect roles of weather that determine exposure to Campylobacter associated with eating chicken, cooking activities, and countryside visits. However, this approach did not allow us to quantify the relative importance of each risk behaviour in causing disease, a key outcome if we are to identify methods to intervene to mitigate against disease. To evaluate the contribution of these different exposure pathways to disease, we developed an IB model which models stochastically the daily experience of human individuals, their risk behaviours and immunity, and integrates with weather and exposure, to predict disease. We tested this model by predicting temporal disease patterns in a large population of individuals in North East England, UK. The region has a population of 910,000 with an area in excess of 2500 km², at 55° latitude N. Finally, we used the IB model to investigate how interventions to extend the duration of immunity and to reduce risk behaviours might reduce the burden of disease.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\nTime-series analyses of cases of disease, human risk behaviours and weather.

Visits to the countryside by the public were obtained from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment survey (MENE) [19] based on interviews of 800+ participants/week across NE England from 2009 to 2015. A proxy variable of barbecue activity in the region was constructed from the internet queries per month for barbecue charcoal in England on Google Trends from 2012 to 2015. Weekly sales of all fresh chicken products were obtained for 2013 to 2015 from one of the UK’s largest supermarkets.\\n\\n# Time-Series Analyses\\n\\nTo investigate the relationships between Campylobacter cases, weather and the three risk-behaviours we de-seasonalised each variable using six sine-cosine harmonic regressions [18]:\\n\\n- Mean temperature/month,\\n- Total rainfall/month,\\n- Campylobacter cases/month,\\n- Barbecue charcoal queries/month,\\n- Sales of broiler chicken/month,\\n- Number of visits to the countryside/day,\\n- Sales of barbecue chicken/month.\\n\\nTemperature, rainfall, Campylobacter cases, charcoal queries and chicken sales were de-seasonalised with an annual cycle whereas visits to the countryside, where more fine-grained data were available, were de-seasonalised for weekly and annual periods. The residuals of each temporal model were used as de-seasonalised representations of the original response variable. Linear regressions were used to determine the relationships between de-seasonalised temperature and rainfall (independent weather predictors) versus de-seasonalised Campylobacter cases and the three risk-behaviours (dependent variables). Likewise, de-seasonalised broiler chicken and barbecue chicken sales were compared with de-seasonalised Campylobacter cases. Non-significant relationships between a de-seasonalised predictor and a de-seasonalised dependent variable were assumed to indicate that the two variables were independent of each other.\\n\\n# IB Model of Impacts of Risk Behaviours, Exposure and Immunology on Campylobacter Disease\\n\\nThe IB model simulates temporal patterns of risk-behaviours, exposure pathways, immune response, and subsequent probability of disease in relation to seasonal variation in weather, age and socio-economic status for individuals (Fig. 1). The processes considered were:\\n\\n- Consumption of barbecued food as a source of Campylobacter,\\n- Infection from chicken preparation and consumption in the home,\\n- Presence of Campylobacter in the countryside as determined by livestock land use,\\n- Visits to the countryside as determined by weather, day of week, age and socio-economic status.\\n\\nFig. 1 Flow diagram of the IB modelling model\\n\\nReferences: [18], [19]\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacter Exposure and Immune Response\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.appendix {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter Exposure and Immune Response\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis paper discusses various parameters related to human exposure to Campylobacter, including sources of exposure, immune response, and the modeling of infection risks.\\n\\n# Parameters Used in the IB Model\\n\\nParameters used in the IB model are summarized in Appendix Table 1.\\n\\n# Sources of Campylobacter Exposure\\n\\n# a. Consumption of Barbecued Food\\n\\nThe relationship between charcoal queries and weather, from the time-series analysis, was used to predict barbecue occurrence on a scale of 0 to 100. Idealo Survey data were used to quantify the frequency of barbecues and their distribution across the days of the week. Frequency of barbecue was assigned to each individual and also the probability that they would have a barbecue on a specific day of the week. Campylobacter exposure was then predicted as the product of two probabilities: first that meat was contaminated and second that the meat was undercooked.\\n\\n# b. Infection from Chicken Preparation and Consumption in the Home\\n\\nWe estimated daily consumption of chicken based on the population known to consume this meat and the amount of chicken consumed. Surface contamination was calculated from: the probability that a purchased chicken was contaminated; the proportion of the chicken that was skin; and the frequency distribution of Campylobacter found on chicken skin purchased from UK retailers. This procedure could not distinguish between barbecue cooking and other forms of chicken consumption, so may have led to an over-estimate of the contribution of chicken. Exposure to cross-contamination and likely transmission were modeled after Nauta et al.\\n\\n# c. Presence of Campylobacter in the Countryside\\n\\nCampylobacter strains in the countryside were predicted to arise from sheep, wild birds, and cattle. Sheep and wild bird contamination was assumed to be constant throughout the year, whilst that of bovine contamination was seasonal, occurring only after grass growth was sufficient to maintain stock for 10 days. We predicted grass growth using a modified Gompertz model.\\n\\n# d. Visits to the Countryside\\n\\nGeneralized estimating equations (GEE with Wald tests) were used to predict the probability that an individual would visit the countryside from the MENE data. We modeled visit on each day of the week as a logistic response and included an autoregressive correlation structure to account for serial dependency between days using temperature, rainfall, day of the week, age, and socioeconomic class as predictors.\\n\\n# e. Exposure to Campylobacter in the Countryside\\n\\nExposure to Campylobacter was assumed to be via footwear. We assumed that on handling footwear, Campylobacter would be transmitted to hands and the relationships of Nauta et al. were used to model the transmission of Campylobacter to hands and food.\\n\\n# f. Strains Encountered When Individuals Were Exposed\\n\\nPathogen strain-type was derived from the frequency distribution of strain-types recorded in the field. The dose was set arbitrarily at 0.1 g to provide an invisible and conservative estimate of contamination. Campylobacter counts in sheep, cattle, and wild bird feces were derived from Stanley et al.\\n\\n# g. Immune Response of an Individual After Exposure to Campylobacter\\n\\nWe assumed that the dose consumed affected the likelihood of becoming ill. Exposure may or may not result in illness but only cases with moderate or severe illness will be reported. Illness depends on both dose and extent of previous exposure and immunity. We modeled the illness response of humans to exposure using data derived from human dose response experiments and assumed that cooking on a barbecue would result in a 2.5-fold reduction in the dose of colony forming units (CFU). The modeled dose was used to predict the likelihood of illness subject to the predicted level of immunity at the time of exposure. Immunity was assumed to decline exponentially from the time of exposure to zero at a pre-defined time, which could be set as a model input variable. Whilst exposure to Campylobacter may not cause illness, the antigens present may still initiate a response from the host immune system, so any exposure to Campylobacter which did not lead to illness was assumed to...\\n\\n# Appendix\\n\\nAppendix Table 1: Summary of parameters used in the IB model.\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Impacts of Weather on Disease and Human Behavior'),\n",

A cohort population of 10,000 individuals was created for each simulation. Individuals were assigned age, gender, and socio-economic class based on the socio-economic structure in NE England. The initial immune status of individuals was a normal random deviate (mean 0.5, SD 0.2). We predicted cases for the whole population and compared with the log-transformed monthly number of cases using generalized linear models (GLM). We ran the model 10 times from the same starting conditions and produced a mean number of cases per month and associated standard errors on our predictions.\\n\\n# Modifying Human Risk Behaviours and Immunity to Mitigate Against Disease\\n\\nWe varied parameter estimates for risk behaviours, weather, and immunity. The following input parameters were used:\\n\\n- Extending the period of immunity leading to protection from developing disease (21 to 1095 days) as might be undertaken following an intervention to enhance immunity following infection, such as vaccination with a hypothetical polysaccharide vaccine that produced short-term immunity.\\n- Probability of chicken being undercooked (contamination reduction per cooking event) as would occur following implementation of an education program to reduce risk of exposure in domestic settings.\\n- Fold-reduction in CFU dose in food from either cooking or reducing the burden in raw chicken (1.5 to 2.5) as would occur following implementation of an education program or a scheme to reduce the CFU on raw chicken during production.\\n- Temperature (± 2.5 °C) and rainfall (± 10 mm). These assess impacts of weather on visits to the countryside and barbecue behaviour.\\n\\nWe used Latin Hypercube Sampling to create ranges for input parameters and used GLMs to quantify the contribution of each variable to the predicted number of cases.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Impacts of Temperature and Rainfall on Campylobacter Cases in NE England\\n\\nThe number of reported cases was highly seasonal, rising to a peak in early summer (June) each year and closely matched the seasonality in temperature and rainfall. The seasonality was well-described with harmonic regression models which were significant for Campylobacter cases (t = − 7.448, P < 0.001 and t = − 7.436, P < 0.001 for cosine and sine variables of time with a 365-day period) and monthly mean temperature (t = − 18.710, P < 0.001; t = − 25.300, P < 0.001). There was evidence for periodicity in the rainfall (t = 3.634, P < 0.001 for cosine variable).\\n\\nWe used the residuals from these models as de-seasonalised measures of each variable to investigate links between variables and disease. De-seasonalised counts of Campylobacter cases were not significantly related to de-seasonalised temperature after also adjusting for autocorrelation (t = 0.212, P = 0.230) or rainfall (t = − 0.119, P = 0.906). This suggests that the simple seasonal relationship between monthly number of cases of Campylobacter and mean monthly temperature and rainfall is not a true one and was in fact related to other unmeasured seasonally-varying phenomena.\\n\\n# Impacts of Temperature and Rainfall on Visits to the Countryside of NE England\\n\\nTotal visits to the countryside and daily mean temperature showed seasonal variation across the study period. Temperature was highly seasonal with the harmonic regression for temperature significant (t = − 65.950, P < 0.001 and t = 45.830, P < 0.001 for cosine and sine variables). There was evidence of seasonal variation in the rainfall (t = − 5.266, P < 0.001 for cosine variable).\\n\\nThe log-transformed count of visits to the countryside per day showed marked annual (t = − 4.157, P < 0.001; t = 5.328, P < 0.001) and weekly (t = − 3.220, P = 0.001; t = 5.736, P < 0.001) periodicities, reflecting the seasonal weather and periodicity associated with the working week. There was a significant linear relationship between the de-seasonalised visits and that for temperature and rainfall data (t = 3.665, P < 0.001 and t = − 2.187, P = 0.029 for temperature and rainfall respectively). This suggests that in contrast with the occurrence of cases of disease, weather variables were important drivers of people visiting the countryside.\\n\\nFurthermore, there was a significant relationship between the probability of an individual undertaking a visit to the countryside and weather, socio-economic status, and age. GEE Wald test statistics (W) indicated that visits to the countryside were positively associated with increased temperature (W = 16.343, P < 0.001), weekends (Saturday: W = 53.370, P < 0.001).\\n---\\n# Impact of Temperature and Rainfall on Barbecue Activities and Chicken Sales\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n.data-table {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n.data-table th, .data-table td {\\nborder: 1px solid #ddd;\\npadding: 8px;\\n}\\n.data-table th {\\nbackground-color: #f2f2f2;\\n}\\n\\n# Impact of Temperature and Rainfall on Barbecue Activities and Chicken Sales\\n\\n# Monthly Recorded Cases of Campylobacter in NE England (2005-2009)\\n\\nFig. 2 Monthly recorded cases of Campylobacter in NE England 2005 to 2009 in relation to temperature\\n\\n# Analysis of Internet Queries for Barbecue Charcoal\\n\\nWeb queries for barbecue charcoal in England over the study period were used as a surrogate for barbecue activities. The queries were highly seasonal, with significant harmonic regression coefficients (sine t = −2.606, P = 0.010; cosine t = 2.457, P = 0.015). De-seasonalised query data were significantly related to temperature and rainfall in the week of the queries, indicating that queries were influenced by weather rather than other unmeasured seasonal trends.\\n\\nDe-seasonalised queries were positively associated with maximum weekly temperature (t = 11.014, P < 0.001) but negatively associated with the minimum average weekly temperature (t = −3.626, P < 0.001). This suggests that interest in barbecue charcoal was driven by weather conditions.\\n\\n# Impact of Temperature and Rainfall on Sales of Chicken Products\\n\\nThere was a seasonal pattern to the sales of raw chicken products, with significant harmonic regression for chicken consumption (cosine t = 16.300, P < 0.001; sine t = 15.560, P < 0.001). However, after subsequent de-seasonalising, the relationships between chicken sales and temperature and rainfall were not significant (t = −0.903, P = 0.368 and t = 0.897, P = 0.372, respectively). This indicates that temperature and rainfall were not significant drivers of chicken purchases.\\n---\\n# Impact of Chicken Product Sales and Countryside Visits on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n\\n# Impact of Chicken Product Sales and Countryside Visits on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nThis research paper examines the relationship between chicken product sales, countryside visits, and the incidence of Campylobacter cases in Northeast England from 2009 to 2015.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\n# Impact of Chicken Product Sales on Campylobacter Cases'),\n",

This suggests that sales of both all raw chicken and raw “barbecue” chicken alone did not have a direct effect on the numbers of Campylobacter cases.\\n\\n# Impact of Monthly Total of Countryside Visits on Campylobacter Cases\\n\\nThere were no significant relationships between de-seasonalised total monthly visits to the countryside and Campylobacter cases (t = −0.541, P = 0.59). This suggests that monthly visits to the countryside had little influence on numbers of cases.\\n\\n# Summary of Findings\\n\\nIn summary, the time series analyses suggest that weather appeared to influence visits to the countryside and also the pursuit of barbecues, but was not itself a driver of cases of disease. However, the number of cases was associated with our measure of barbecue activity and hence indirectly with weather.\\n\\n# Results of the IB Model\\n\\nThe predicted number of Campylobacter cases from the IB model, using weather and socio-demographic data as inputs, followed a cyclic pattern, with cases lowest in winter but rising to a peak in early summer. The observed numbers of cases fitted reasonably well within the 95% confidence intervals for our model predictions. There was a significant positive correlation between the mean numbers of observed and predicted cases per month for NE England over the study period. Mean number of predicted and observed cases per month were compared using generalized linear models, and predictions were...\\n\\nFig. 3 Daily counts of visits to the countryside in NE England and mean daily temperature, 2009–2015\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Interventions to Mitigate Disease\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\nfigcaption {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ntext-align: center;\\ncolor: #666;\\n}\\n\\n# Interventions to Mitigate Against Disease\\n\\nIn this study, we altered immunity, daily temperature, and rainfall, which affect both barbecue activity and visits to the countryside, the probability of under-cooking chicken, and the effectiveness of cooking/reduced cfu load on chicken. We then re-ran the IB model to predict the number of cases of disease.\\n\\nAll interventions significantly reduced the predicted total number of Campylobacter cases, but the effectiveness of the interventions differed greatly. Extending the duration of immunity through vaccination of the population had the largest effect on the level of disease (t = 56.072, P < 0.001), explaining more than 95% of the variation in predicted number of cases relative to the other interventions.\\n\\nExtending immunity from 20 days to 1 year reduced the predicted number of cases by an order of magnitude (95% CI 2412–2414 to 203–309 per 50,000 person-years).

The models suggest that behaviors driven by weather that lead to consumption of barbecued chicken, and to a lesser extent visits to the countryside, lead to exposure and disease. More importantly, they indicate that consideration of the immune-dynamics of the host–pathogen interaction is necessary to understand the relative role of different exposure pathways to disease.\\n\\nThere are obvious limitations of the modeling. Data were derived from different studies with overlapping time periods. We hypothesized that the processes investigated were both causal and also consistent through time. We cannot assess the impacts of these assumptions on the model formally, but note that the patterns of disease in the UK are predictably consistent year-on-year. We did not model all processes identified as risk factors. We excluded exposure at non-domestic food establishments and cases associated with foreign travel.\\n\\nStrachan et al. suggested national and international travel accounted for 18% and 17% of cases respectively. We note that both of these risk behaviors are likely to be seasonal in themselves. It is difficult to quantify the contribution of cases arising from travel because of poor ascertainment. However, travel in its own right is unlikely to be a mechanism leading to disease, but rather it could lead to changes in human behaviors or in exposure to new strains or both. We also did not model variation in...\\n---\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.reference {\\nfont-size: 0.9em;\\ncolor: #555;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper on Campylobacter\\n\\n# Abstract\\n\\nThis paper discusses the immune response to different *Campylobacter strains, highlighting the genetic diversity of C. jejuni* and its implications for disease development.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nRecent evidence shows that *C. jejuni* undergoes transcriptional and genetic adaptation during human infection.

However, developing a vaccine for humans is complicated due to the poor understanding of underlying immunology and potential interactions with post-infection syndromes.\\n\\nDevelopment costs for vaccines are estimated between $2.8–3.7 billion, which must be weighed against the disease burden costs in the EU, estimated at €2.4 billion to €2.7 billion annually.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nOur findings underscore the importance of understanding the interplay between human behavior, environmental factors, and pathogen dynamics in addressing *Campylobacter* infections.\\n\\n# References\\n\\n[6, 7, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]\\n---\\n# Research Paper - Campylobacteriosis Mitigation\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1, h2, h3 {\\ncolor: #333;\\n}\\nh1 {\\nfont-size: 24px;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nfont-size: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nfont-size: 18px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.authors, .affiliations, .acknowledgements, .competing-interests, .data-availability, .consent, .ethics, .funding {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nborder-top: 1px solid #ccc;\\npadding-top: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Research Paper: Mitigating Campylobacteriosis\\n\\nFood-borne disease have been less frequent. One study in the US, with a budget of $300 K, led to a program in which 14,062 people participated with a reduction in disease risk of 12.8% [49]. The benefits of this level of prevention were considered sufficient to outweigh the costs. However, the practicality of behavioural interventions at anything other than the small scale probably means they are impractical given the sizeable disease burden and the lack of efficacy suggested by our analyses.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThis is the first inter-disciplinary study to integrate environment, risk behaviour, socio-demographics and immunology to model infectious disease and identify pathways to mitigation. We conclude that vaccination is likely to be the best route for intervening against campylobacteriosis despite the technical problems associated with understanding both the underlying human immunology and genetic variation in the pathogen, and the likely cost of vaccine development.\\n\\n# Abbreviations\\n\\n- GEE: generalised estimating equations\\n- IB: individual-based\\n- MENE: Monitoring of Engagement with the Natural Environment\\n- CFU: colony forming units\\n\\n# Authors’ Contributions\\n\\nSPR undertook the modelling and was lead author on the manuscript; RAS validated model runs and prepared figures; all authors contributed to the conception of the project and writing the manuscript.
