    "\n",
    "The seasonality of rotavirus differs between tropical and temperate climates. In temperate zones, rotavirus is more common in cooler months, with a strong winter peak observed primarily in the Americas (Seasonality of Rotavirus in South Asia_ A Meta-Analysis Approach Assessing Associations with Temperature_ Precipitation_ and Vegetation Index.pdf pages 1-2). However, in tropical regions, the pattern is less defined, and autumn/spring peaks are more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tropical climates, rotavirus incidence responds to changes in climate, with the highest number of infections found at the colder and drier times of the year (levy2009seasonalityofrotavirus pages 1-1). Monthly rotavirus incidence is significantly negatively correlated with temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity in the majority of studies reviewed (levy2009seasonalityofrotavirus pages 8-8).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to temperate areas, where rotavirus incidence often goes to zero in some months, tropical regions experience year-round rotavirus activity with peaks and valleys (levy2009seasonalityofrotavirus pages 6-6). The effect of seasonal changes on rotavirus incidence is not as extreme in the tropics as it is in temperate areas. Less climatic variability exists in tropical climates, which may explain why variations in climatological variables are not large enough to cause the observed effect (levy2009seasonalityofrotavirus pages 6-6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the seasonality of rotavirus disease in tropical countries differs from that observed in temperate zones, with tropical regions experiencing year-round activity and responding to changes in climate (levy2009seasonalityofrotavirus pages 8-8).\n",
