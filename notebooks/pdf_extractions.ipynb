[1] Unlike many bacteriological agents of\\ndiarrhoeal illness, rotavirus occurs in both temperate\\nand tropical areas. Rotavirus infections are universal\\ndiseases of children, regardless of the level of hygiene\\nthat prevails or the quality of food and water.\\nChildren in developed countries are infected at the\\nsame ages and as frequently as those in less\\ndeveloped countries. [2] However, an estimated 82% of\\nthe 1205 children who die each day from rotavirus\\ndisease live in the poorest countries of the world,\\npossibly because of inadequate access to hydration\\ntherapy and a greater prevalence of malnutrition. [3]\\n\\nA review of 43 studies from 15 countries on the\\nAfrican continent found rotavirus to be the single\\nmost common cause of diarrhoea, responsible\\nfor about one-quarter of all diarrhoea cases identified\\nin both hospital patients and outpatients. [4]\\n\\n\\n1487\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n1488 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY\\n\\nRotavirus is believed to be spread predominantly\\nthrough fecal-oral transmission, through water,\\nperson-to-person contact, or contaminated environmental surfaces, although respiratory secretions have\\nalso been speculated as a source of infection. [5]\\n\\nRotaviruses are highly infectious. Replication within\\nthe intestinal tract can result in shedding of 510 [10]\\n\\ninfectious particles (PFU) per ml (3 � 10 [11] PFU/oz) of\\nfeces and the infectious dose for the human small\\nintestine has been calculated as only �10 PFU/ml\\n(300 PFU/oz). [6] Rotaviruses are very durable in the\\nenvironment and can survive for weeks on surfaces\\nand in potable and recreational water. [7]\\n\\nRotavirus exhibits distinct seasonality, and has been\\nknown as ‘winter diarrhoea’ in some parts of the\\nworld. ‘Winter gastroenteritis’ and ‘winter vomiting\\ndisease’ were recognized illnesses of early childhood\\nbefore rotavirus was identified and found to be their\\ncause. [2] However, the most recent review of the global\\nseasonality of rotavirus infections concluded that the\\nwinter seasonality of rotavirus infections is too simple\\na generalization. The authors of this study systematically reviewed 34 epidemiological studies of childhood diarrhoea from a wide range of countries, and\\nconcluded that globally in temperate zones, rotavirus\\nis certainly more common in the cooler months, but\\nthe seasonal peaks of the infections can vary broadly\\nand occur from autumn to spring. Strict winter\\nseasonality was common only in the Americas and\\nwas the exception in other parts of the world. In the\\ntropics (between latitudes 23827 [0] north and south of\\nthe equator), this seasonality, defined by calendar\\nyear, was even less distinct. Of 10 surveys conducted\\nwithin 108 north or south of the equator, eight\\nexhibited no distinct seasonal trend. Farther from the\\nequator, at latitudes 108 to 23827 [0] north and south,\\nfive of six studies showed a distinct seasonal peak—\\ntwo in winter, two in the autumn and winter, and\\none in the autumn. [2]\\n\\nDespite these inconclusive results for the tropical\\nbelt, many other authors have referred to clustering\\nduring the cool, dry season in the tropics. [8] In a\\nsystematic review of rotavirus in Africa, rotavirus was\\ndetected year-round in nearly every country and\\ngenerally exhibited distinct peaks during the dry\\nmonths. Peaks were more common during dry periods\\nthan wet periods, but this pattern was not consistent\\nfor every country. [4] Because of the high burden of\\nrotavirus disease in developing countries and because\\nmany of these countries lie in the tropical belt, further\\nanalysis of the seasonal patterns of rotavirus in\\ntropical countries can shed light on the epidemiology\\nof this important disease. Two live oral vaccines,\\nprepared by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Merck, have\\ncompleted promising large scale clinical trials and are\\ncurrently being introduced on a global scale. [9–12] The\\nnext generation of rotavirus vaccines will have the\\ngreatest potential impact in developing countries\\nwhere the disease burden is greatest, [3,13,14] but more\\n\\n\\ninformation about the epidemiology and behaviour of\\nrotavirus in these countries is needed to ensure high\\nefficacy and safety of the new vaccines. [15] This\\ninformation on the role of climatic drivers of rotavirus\\ntransmission in the tropics is important in increasing\\nour understanding of the epidemiology and transmission of rotavirus disease.\\nIn their analysis, Cook et al. defined winter as\\nDecember–March in the northern hemisphere and\\nJune–September in the southern hemisphere. [2] While\\nthis classification of season by month is appropriate\\nfor temperate climates, in tropical zones distinct\\nseasonality might occur that does not conform to\\nthese monthly classifications. In the tropics, seasonality may be driven by pressure belts and local air\\ncirculation patterns rather than changes in the\\namount of sunlight during different parts of the\\nyear. Therefore local climatological factors might\\nprovide more insight into seasonal patterns of\\nrotavirus infection in this region of the world.\\nAt the time that Cook et al. carried out their review,\\nattempts to relate rotavirus disease incidence to\\nclimatological factors such as rainfall, humidity and\\ntemperature had not provided any conclusive results. [2]\\n\\nIn 16 years since the publication of their global\\nreview, many more studies have been carried out on\\nrotavirus incidence, in anticipation of a vaccine for\\nthis disease. For example, a recent study compared\\nhospital admissions for rotavirus with climatic factors\\nin three Australian cities, finding that higher temperature and humidity in the previous week were\\nassociated with a decrease in rotavirus admissions. [16]\\n\\nIn an effort to increase our understanding of the\\ntransmission and epidemiology of rotavirus disease,\\nthis paper updates the knowledge of seasonality of\\nrotavirus infection in tropical countries through a\\nsystematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between monthly rotavirus prevalence and\\nclimatological variables (temperature, rainfall and\\nrelative humidity) for those same months.\\n## Methods\\n\\nSearch strategy & selection criteria\\nStudies published between 1974 and 1988 were\\nidentified by Cook et al., [2] and those carried out from\\n1988 through December 2005 were identified through\\na PubMed search for ‘rotavirus and season.’ Additionally, reference lists from several key reviews of\\nrotavirus epidemiology were scanned for identification\\nof relevant papers. [3,4,7]\\n\\nThe criteria for study selection used by Cook et al.\\nincluded: (i) conducted continuously for 1 year or more;\\n(ii) more than 50 confirmed cases of rotavirus diarrhoea\\nreported; and (iii) monthly data on the proportion of all\\npatients with diarrhoea caused by rotavirus described. [2]\\n\\nThese same criteria were employed, although total\\nnumber of monthly rotavirus cases was used, rather\\nthan proportion of diarrhoea patients testing\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\npositive for rotavirus, to avoid specious results driven\\nby seasonal changes in other diarrhoea pathogens.\\nIn particular, bacterial pathogens in particular are\\nknown to peak in summer months. Assuming that\\neach study carried out consistent case identification for\\nall months of the year, rotavirus case count data would\\nbe reliable within each particular study. In addition,\\nfive further criteria were required for inclusion:\\n(i) study site within 248 north or south of the equator;\\n(ii) monthly data on at least one of the following\\nclimatological variables was reported or available from\\nanother source: temperature, rainfall or relative humidity; (iii) study location was confined to a geographic\\narea to which a single weather data set would apply\\n(i.e. no country-wide studies); (iv) study was written\\nin either English or Spanish; and (v) study had a\\nsurveillance (rather than case-control or cohort) design\\nto minimize variation in approaches to case identification; papers describing the results of case-control\\nstudies were only included if the authors reported\\nrotavirus incidence for cases identified through hospital\\ndiarrhoea surveillance separately from controls. Cohort\\nstudies were excluded. A total of 26 articles fit these\\ncriteria and were included in the analysis presented\\nhere. Six papers were excluded because of publication language; these papers were not examined so\\nit is unknown whether they met the other inclusion\\ncriteria.\\nAll data reported in the published papers was taken\\ndirectly from tables or extracted from graphs using\\nDigitizeIt software (I Bormann; www.digitizeit.de).\\nMonthly climatological data for each region were\\ntaken from the published paper or from online\\ndatabases of historical climatological data of the US\\nNational Climatic Data Center. [17–19] Latitude, altitude,\\naverage yearly temperature and average yearly rainfall\\n(or number of days of rain per year for the study\\nlocation) were taken from Weatherbase. [20]\\n\\nAnalysis\\nTo estimate the association of climatological variables\\nand the frequency of rotavirus, univariate generalized\\nlog-linear Poisson regression models were carried out\\nfor each study location, using monthly data of\\nnumber of rotavirus cases per month. The inference\\non the associations was adjusted to account for the\\npossibility of serial dependence of the residuals (a\\ncommon problem when time-series are compared) by\\nusing a Newey regression approach. [21] A 5-month and\\n12-month lag in residual auto-correlations was\\nassumed for studies that were carried out for less\\nthan or equal to and 415 months, respectively; the\\nresulting statistical inference was not sensitive to\\nassumptions on the correlation lag.\\nStudies were also combined to get an overall\\n(average) association between monthly rotavirus\\nincidence (count) and mean temperature, mean\\nrainfall and relative humidity using a generalized\\nestimating equation (GEE) approach, controlling for\\n\\n\\nSEASONALITY OF ROTAVIRUS DISEASE 1489\\n\\nresidual (within study) correlation and using a loglinear (Poisson regression) link. [22] An auto-regressive\\n(AR1) working correlation model was used, with\\nrobust standard errors to protect the inference against\\nmisspecification of this model. This approach accounts\\nfor correlation stemming from between-study variation\\nas well as serial correlation in monthly data points\\nwithin studies. Because studies differ in their mean\\nnumbers of rotavirus (due both to different incidences\\nas well as different and sometimes unknown denominators) we also included ‘study’ as a categorical (fixed\\neffect) variable in the model. This can be thought of as\\nstratifying by study and thus assumes studies have\\ndifferent underlying (baseline) mean counts of rotavirus (due in part to having different population sizes),\\nbut assumes the association (relative rate for a unit\\nincrease) of the climate variables is the same for all\\nstudies. If this is not true, the resulting estimate of the\\nsingle association can be thought of as a weighted\\naverage relative rate. Because the climatological variables are highly related to one another, separate\\nanalyses were carried out for each.\\nA random effects model was used for assessing\\nwithin- and between-study heterogeneity in rotavirus\\nincidence and overall heterogeneity between studies\\nin the association of rotavirus incidence and climatological variables was tested with a meta-analysis\\nfunction. Covariates including altitude, latitude, average monthly rainfall, average temperature, range in\\ntemperature, range in rainfall, duration of study and\\ntotal number of rotavirus cases reported were\\nexplored for patterns that explained residual variability. Specifically, we included multiplicative interaction terms of categorical study*climatological variable\\nand tested the overall significance of this interaction.\\nWe examined whether adding other study-specific\\nvariables changed the significance of the overall test\\nof study*climatological variable interaction. All statistical analyses were carried out using STATA software.\\n## Results\\n\\nA total of 26 studies from 15 countries between\\nlatitudes 248S and 248N were included in the analysis\\n(Table 1). [23–48] These studies took place between 1975\\nand 2003, with study duration ranging from 1 to 10\\nyears. In some studies, enrolment was limited to\\nchildren, and in others all ages were included.\\nHowever, most of the patients were children because\\nof the predominance of rotavirus disease in infants\\nand young children.\\nIn the univariate analyses, an inverse relationship\\nbetween monthly rotavirus incidence and climatological variables was consistently found in the data;\\n65%, 55% and 60% of studies showed a significant\\nnegative association with temperature, rainfall and\\nrelative humidity, respectively. For the same respective variables, only 10%, 18% and 0% had significant\\npositive correlations.\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n1490 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nSEASONALITY OF ROTAVIRUS DISEASE 1491\\n\\nThe pooled results are shown in Table 2. The model\\ncan be interpreted as a weighted average of the\\nindividual study estimates to produce a pooled\\nmeasure of association, the incidence rate ratio\\n(IRR), which is simply interpreted literally—the\\nratio of mean rates in two different populations that\\ndiffer by a specified change in the exposure. One can\\nalso report the relative effect, or 1-IRR, expressed as a\\npercentage change. These models suggest that on\\naverage, across all studies analysed, for every 18C\\n(1.88F) increase in mean temperature, the incidence\\nof rotavirus decreases by 10% [IRR ¼ 0.90 (95% CI:\\n0.87–0.94); P < 0.0001]; for every 1 cm (0.39 in.)\\nincrease in mean monthly rainfall, the incidence\\nof rotavirus decreases by 1% [IRR ¼ 0.99 (95% CI:\\n0.99–1.00); P ¼ 0.001]; and for every 1% increase in\\nrelative humidity, the incidence of rotavirus decreases\\nby 3% [IRR ¼ 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–1.00); P ¼ 0.018]. For\\nthe median values for the studies of mean temperature [78C (12.68F)], mean monthly rainfall [31 cm\\n(12.2 in.)] and relative humidity (22%) the analysis\\nshowed reductions in rotavirus incidence of 51%\\n\\n[IRR ¼ 0.49 (95% CI: 0.37–0.65); P < 0.0001],\\n21% [IRR ¼ 0.79 (95% CI: 0.69–0.91); P ¼ 0.001], and\\n44% [IRR ¼ 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34–0.90); P ¼ 0.018],\\nrespectively.\\nThe meta-analysis revealed significant heterogeneity\\n(P < 0.0001) in studies for all climatological variables\\nassessed. This heterogeneity between studies can be\\nassessed visually in Figure 1, which plots the results\\nof the univariate regression analyses, showing Newey\\nWest standard errors. Examining the residual variance\\nof rotavirus incidence in simple random effects\\nmodels (one for each of the climatological variables\\nof interest) within the random effects (GLS) model,\\n12–39% of unexplained variation in the model was\\nseen within studies, and 61–88% was seen between\\nstudies (Table 2). The most relevant heterogeneity\\nwas that for the associations of incidence of rotavirus\\nand climatological variables and this was significant\\nfor all the climate variables. When the interaction of\\nthese climatological variables and study was assessed\\n(as described in the methods section), none of the\\ncovariates explored (altitude, latitude, average\\nmonthly rainfall, average temperature, range in temperature, range in rainfall, duration of study and total\\nnumber of rotavirus cases reported) could explain the\\nbetween-study heterogeneity seen in the variability of\\nassociation of climatological variables on the incidence of rotavirus.\\n## Discussion\\n\\nThe results of this review suggest that numbers of\\nrotavirus infections tend to be highest under cool, dry\\nconditions in the tropics. Negative associations\\nbetween monthly rotavirus prevalence and climatological variables analysed predominate in both the\\nunivariate and pooled analyses.

According to the pooled GEE analysis, low\\nvalues of all climatological variables predicted\\nincreased monthly incidence of rotavirus disease in\\npatients with gastroenteritis.\\nUsing data on the total number of monthly rotavirus\\ncases, rather than proportion of diarrhoea patients\\ntesting positive for rotavirus, avoided the potential for\\nreporting on patterns driven by seasonal changes in\\nother diarrhoea pathogens. However, we should note\\nthat similar results were found with both approaches\\n(total case count and proportion of diarrhoea cases\\ntesting positive for rotavirus).\\nThe effect of seasonal changes on rotavirus incidence seen here is not as extreme in the tropics as it\\nis in temperate areas of the world. Rotavirus is found\\nyear-round in the tropics with peaks and valleys,\\nwhereas incidence often goes to zero in some months\\nin temperate areas. One explanation for this phenomenon is that less climatic variability exists in tropical\\nclimates and zones, so variations in climatological\\nvariables are not large enough to cause the observed\\neffect. Still, the fact that rotavirus persists year-round\\nin tropical areas of the world, and that rotavirus\\nresponds to climatic changes in many different\\nclimatic zones throughout the world, suggests that it\\nis not an absolute temperature or humidity level that\\nfavors rotavirus transmission, but rather a relative\\nchange in climatic conditions.\\nWe see a large amount of heterogeneity both within\\nand between studies in the pooled analysis. The\\nsignificant unexplained variation is a limitation of the\\nstudy. The heterogeneity suggests that we would expect\\nto see a stronger effect, and therefore have greater\\npredictive power, if we could reduce some of the sources\\nof variation between the different studies reviewed,\\nsuch as socioeconomic status of patients, age of\\npatients, sampling scheme, diagnostic methods used,\\nlengths of studies, numbers of participants sampled,\\npopulations of study regions and differing climatic\\nconditions at each study location. Most studies\\nincluded only children while others included patients\\n\\n\\nof all ages. Also, the majority of studies reviewed were\\ncarried out for 2 years or less, which is a relatively short\\nperiod of time to capture the effects of seasonality;\\nstudies of longer duration are preferable for establishing the relationship between climate and rotavirus\\ndisease. While all studies lie within the latitudes\\ndefined as the tropics, various climatic regimes (e.g.\\nrainforest vs semi-arid) prevail in the different settings\\nand at different altitudes, potentially confounding the\\nresults. We were unable to account for these differences\\nin our analysis of potential covariates.\\n\\nUnderstanding rotavirus transmission\\nThe heterogeneity in effect observed in the pooled\\nanalysis is not surprising given that this analysis did\\nnot take into account additional factors potentially\\naffecting rotavirus transmission, such as sanitation\\nand hygiene practices or flood peaks. Several authors\\nof the articles reviewed noted multiple peaks in\\nrotavirus incidence as affected by the monsoon rains\\n(Table 1). Flooding in conjunction with poor sanitation could augment the waterborne component of\\nrotavirus transmission, obfuscating the seasonal patterns, which might be driven more by other routes of\\ntransmission, such as the air or fomites.\\nStrong evidence suggests that rotavirus is a waterborne pathogen. The virus can retain its infectivity for\\nseveral days in aqueous environments, and waterborne spread has been implicated in a number\\nof rotavirus outbreaks. [7] However, the high rates of\\ninfection in the first 3 years of life regardless of\\nsanitary conditions, the failure to document fecal-oral\\ntransmission in several outbreaks of rotavirus diarrhoea, and the dramatic spread of rotavirus over large\\ngeographic areas in the winter in temperate zones\\nsuggests that water alone may not be responsible for\\nall rotavirus transmission. [5] No direct evidence shows\\nthat fomites and environmental surfaces play a role in\\nthe spread of rotavirus gastroenteritis, but indirect\\nevidence shows that these possess a strong potential\\nfor spreading rotavirus gastroenteritis. Rotaviruses can\\nremain viable on inanimate surfaces for several days\\nwhen dried from a fecal suspension. [7]\\n\\nMany authors have also suggested that rotavirus\\nspreads through the air. In nosocomial outbreaks of\\nrotavirus gastroenteritis, many patients show\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n**A**\\n\\n**B**\\n\\n**C**\\n\\n\\n**Relative Humidity (%)**\\n\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\nSEASONALITY OF ROTAVIRUS DISEASE 1493\\n\\n**Mean Monthly Temperature (ºC)**\\n\\n**Study location [Ref]**\\n\\n**Mean Monthly Rainfall (cm)**\\n\\n**Study location [Ref]**\\n\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0\\n\\nStudy Location [Ref]\\n\\nFigure 1 Heterogeneity plots of incidence rate ratios (IRR), showing 95% confidence intervals using Newey West standard\\nerrors, for regressions of rotavirus incidence vs: (A) monthly mean temperature (8C); (B) monthly rainfall (cm); and (C)\\nrelative humidity (%). The pooled effect from the generalized estimated equation (GEE) analysis is also shown\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n1494 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY\\n\\nsymptoms of upper respiratory tract infection before the\\nonset of diarrhoea, although the rotavirus has not been\\nisolated from the respiratory tract. [7] Other evidence also\\npoints to a respiratory mode of spread. For example,\\nlarge outbreaks have been recorded in both mid-Pacific\\nisland groups and Native American reservations where\\naffected population groups were widely separated\\ngeographically. In both of these cases, each population\\nhad its own water supply and the rotavirus epidemic\\nspread rapidly with little or no contact between the\\nvarious groups. [8] In the United States, seasonal rotavirus activity occurs in a sequential manner, beginning\\nfirst in the Southwest from October through December\\nand ending in the Northeast in April or May. [49] This\\npattern of seasonal spread is similar to other respiratory\\nviruses such as influenza and measles. [8] Bishop proposes that the explanation for these patterns might lie\\nin the airborne spread of aerosolized particles that are\\ningested, rather than through respiratory tract\\ninfections. [6]\\n\\nWe speculate that the airborne component of\\nrotavirus transmission might be responsible for the\\nseasonal pattern of rotavirus disease. A relative drop\\nin humidity and rainfall combined with drying of\\nsoils in higher temperatures might increase the aerial\\ntransport of dried, contaminated fecal material (in the\\nform of droplet nuclei), and might also lead to\\nincreased formation of dust, which could provide a\\nsubstrate for the virus particles. Increased burning of\\norganic materials during the dry season may also\\nincrease the amount of particulates in the air.\\nAirborne particles could settle out and infect water\\nsupplies or environmental surfaces, or could be\\ningested. Particles carried on fomites such as clothing\\ncould also play a role in large-scale dispersal of\\nrotavirus organisms.\\n## KEY MESSAGES\\n\\n\\nSome mechanical force would likely be required for\\naerosolization to occur, and wind might play this role,\\nas well as help disperse the particles once formed.\\nIn a 4-year study of rotavirus in Pune, India, a tight\\ncorrelation was seen between number of days with\\neasterly wind and the number of rotavirus diarrhoea\\ncases as functions of time. [34] Further research on the\\nrelationship between wind patterns and rotavirus\\nincidence might shed light on this potential transmission mechanism.\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nThe widely cited conclusion of Cook et al. [2] that\\nseasonality of rotavirus infections in the tropics is less\\ndistinct than in temperate zones was based on a\\ndefinition of winter as December–March in the\\nnorthern hemisphere and June–September in the\\nsouthern hemisphere. The results of this review\\nsuggest that local climatological variables provide a\\nbetter predictor of seasonality in the tropics, where\\nweather patterns differ from those in the temperate\\nzones. This review reveals a trend for rotavirus to\\noccur in the cool, dry seasons in tropical countries, as\\nobserved in temperate zones. These results suggest\\nthat paying close attention to local climatic conditions\\nwill improve our understanding of the transmission\\nand epidemiology of rotavirus disease.\\n## Funding\\n\\nNational Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\\n(R01AI050038).\\n\\nConflict of interest: None declared.\\n\\n\\n� Incidence of rotavirus disease responds to changes in climate in the tropics, with the highest number of\\ninfections found at the colder and drier times of the year.\\n� Monthly rotavirus incidence is significantly negatively correlated with temperature, rainfall, and relative\\nhumidity in the majority of studies reviewed.\\n� Rotavirus previously was not thought to respond to seasonal changes in tropical regions of the world.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1 Parashar UD, Gibson CJ, Bresee JS, Glass RI.
