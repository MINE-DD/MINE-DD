A deep understanding of temporal patterns in disease occurrence and its governing principles is valuable for designing preventive programs for disease control, tracking effectiveness of public health programs, and allocating scarce resources.\\n\\nMany infectious diseases exhibit seasonal patterns, when systematic periodic fluctuations are observed during an annual cycle. Seasonality can be characterized by the magnitude, timing, and duration of a seasonal increase. It may differ by pathogen and its strain virulence, and may change from year to year due to shift/drift in antigenic strain and change in immunity of a naïve and exposed population. Seasonal characteristics may also vary by population, geographical area, or climate zone. Introduction of a vaccine and/or successful coverage expansion may also dramatically alter the seasonal fluctuations in infectious disease occurrence.\\n\\nPeriodic fluctuations can be successfully detected and modeled using statistical methods, which allows us to describe and compare seasonal characteristics: amplitude, peaks and troughs. An analysis of seasonality has to be performed on a sufficiently long time series to be able to capture many occurrences of seasonal increases. Thus, by abstracting records from large databases of medical records, including laboratory tests, hospitalizations and mortality records, long time series can be successfully compiled to provide the foundation for reliable assessment of disease seasonality. However, each data source might contain only a fraction of all events associated with infection and sometimes may offer biased reflection of a true incidence of infection in a community.\\n\\nWhile surveillance systems are an excellent source of data to study seasonality in a general population, they might not be ideal for tracking unique features of specific diseases. Cohort studies present a unique opportunity to explore intricate details associated.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.ethics, .data-sources, .compilation, .adjustment, .assessment {\\nmargin-bottom: 20px;\\nborder-left: 4px solid #007BFF;\\npadding-left: 10px;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nWith the emergence of seasonal patterns, longitudinal tracking of disease occurrence in each subject allows for the detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, complete genotyping, and comparison of observed strains in the same individual. This also links disease profiles to environmental, social, and genetic features.\\n\\nHowever, the specific features of cohort studies—such as staggered enrollment, age effects, and short follow-up periods—present substantial methodological challenges for seasonality analysis. Current analytical approaches for assessing seasonality are best suited for long time series with relatively stable populations and usually when the patterns of disease have a stable structure. It is useful to expand the methodology of seasonality analysis to this promising study design, which has already demonstrated advantages in understanding the natural history of viral and protozoan infections.\\n\\nRotavirus infection is a leading cause of morbidity in developing countries, and currently, there are a number of suitable vaccines. In temperate areas, the seasonality of rotavirus infection with a single winter peak is well documented. In tropical climates, its seasonality is less defined; however, sometimes an increase is noticed during cold and dry periods. Occasionally, two peaks within a single year are reported: one in winter and one in summer. The burden of rotavirus diarrhea is highest among very young children and decreases rapidly thereafter, which can introduce a strong age effect in the assessment of any temporal pattern.\\n\\n# Methods\\n\\n# Ethics Statement\\n\\nThis paper presents the results of a secondary data analysis from a birth cohort study in southern India, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Christian Medical College, Vellore, India. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of the participating children prior to enrollment, which also included permission to use the data for future research purposes. The time series presented in this study was assembled using de-identified data.\\n\\n# Data Sources\\n\\nWe used data from a birth cohort study on the natural history of rotavirus infection in Vellore, south India. In this study, a total of 452 children were recruited between March 2002 and August 2003 and followed up for a period of 3 years; a total of 373 (80%) children completed the follow-up period. Each child was subjected to a biweekly follow-up schedule to record diarrheal and other morbidities during the preceding days. Surveillance stool samples were collected every 2 weeks, and up to 3 diarrheal stool samples were collected every time the child had diarrhea. The stool samples were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA and PCR-based methods. The details of symptomatic and asymptomatic rotavirus infections over the 3-year period among the 373 children who completed the study have been reported elsewhere.\\n\\nData from all 452 children enrolled in this study was used to illustrate the seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in this cohort. We defined a diarrheal episode to be associated with rotavirus if one or more stool samples collected within 67 days of that episode was positive for rotavirus by PCR. Using this definition, we identified a total of 291 episodes of PCR-positive rotavirus diarrhea among the 452 children in this cohort. We also explored the effect of different rotavirus genotypes in the overall seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea among the study children.\\n\\nDaily data on ambient temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall for Vellore for the study period was obtained from the Regional Meteorological Office in Chennai, India. Average weekly temperature and humidity readings were then computed for the duration of the time series. The total volume of rainfall for a particular week was calculated using the daily rainfall measurements.\\n\\n# Compilation of Time Series\\n\\nAll samples tested for rotavirus contained the date of sample collection; thus, the created time series was 100% complete. Seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by aggregating the daily surveillance data into a weekly time-series of counts. Diarrheal episodes were assigned to the week corresponding to the first day of that episode. A week was defined as seven consecutive days from Sunday to Saturday, irrespective of any overlap between two calendar years. The first week of January 2002 was considered to be the first week of the time-series. Hence, for this study, the week-series commenced from March 10, 2002, and ended on the 243rd week, week ending August 31, 2006, for a total of 234 weeks.\\n\\n# Adjustment for Age and Cohort Effects\\n\\nIn cohort studies with staggered enrollment, there are at least three effects that might impact the time series: staggered enrollment, loss to follow-up, and age effect. To address these factors, two additional time series were created: a time series of weekly counts of the number of children (child-weeks of follow-up) in the study and a time series of the median age of children in a given week. Using the weekly counts of children and events (rotavirus diarrhea), incidence rates per 1000 child-weeks of follow-up were calculated. Therefore, the assessment of seasonality was based on the weekly incidence rates, adjusting for the aging in the cohort.\\n\\n# Assessment of Seasonality\\n\\nThe seasonality of rotavirus diarrhea was assessed by fitting a Poisson harmonic regression (PHM) as a generalized linear model (GLM) considering two annual humps, which were accommodated by including four sine-cosine terms. To adjust for the cohort effect, we expanded the regression model by including child-weeks of follow-up as a linear term. The age effect of rotavirus diarrhea was explored by applying three different models: first using a linear term representing the median age of the cohort for the corresponding week, second by adding a quadratic term for the weekly median age to the linear term, and third by replacing the linear and quadratic terms by adding an exponential term representing the log-transformed median age of the cohort. Based on overall model performance and results interpretation, a linear term to represent the effect of age was selected. Finally, to consider the effects of meteorological variables, variables for weekly average temperature, humidity, and an interaction term were included to reflect the joint effect of temperature and humidity.\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\ntable {\\nwidth: 100%;\\nborder-collapse: collapse;\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\ntable, th, td {\\nborder: 1px solid black;\\n}\\nth, td {\\npadding: 10px;\\ntext-align: left;\\n}\\nfigure {\\nmargin: 20px 0;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nThe sequentially-built final model can thus be depicted as below: incidence of 27.8 episodes per 1000 child-weeks. The predicted incidence from the model was 15.7 episodes per 1000 child-weeks.\\n\\nLog(E½Y) ~ b0 + b1 sin(2πvt) + b2 cos(2πvt) + b3 sin(4πvt) + b4 cos(4πvt) + b5 nt + b6 a + b7 T + b8 P + b9 TP + et, where t is time in weeks, v is frequency of 52.25, Yt is a time-series of incidence, nt is a term for weekly value of child-weeks of follow-up; at is a median age for a cohort at t-week, thus the regression parameter b6 reflects the change in the incidence associated with 1 week; T, P, and TP are values for weekly average temperature, humidity and their cross-product interaction, respectively; b are regression parameters, e is the error term. Using b6 we estimate the age effect as follows: d = 1 - exp{52.25b6}, where d is the percent reduction in the incidence over one year. In this model, parameters b1 through b4 refer to seasonal harmonics.\\n\\nBased on predicted curves, such seasonal increases were observed to repeat at least twice – one around week 72 and 84th week and then another around 96th and 108th week. During the peaks of these intervals (81st and 104th week respectively), the predicted rotavirus incidence was found to be 9.9 and 9.1 episodes per 1000 child-weeks respectively; and the median age of the cohort was 32.9 and 55.3 weeks respectively. A smaller hump was also observed at the inception of the study, peaking at the 25th week when the first 68 children were enrolled. The median age of the cohort at this time was 6 weeks, thereby indicating neonatal and early childhood infections.\\n\\n# Results\\n\\nThe cumulative weekly distribution and the relative contribution of the different rotavirus genotypes are presented in Figure 4. Visualization of these data suggests clustering of rotavirus genotypes at certain time points. For example, rotavirus G1P [8] was the predominant circulating genotype between the 52nd and 67th weeks, whereas between the 103rd and 116th week, G2P [4] was found to be more common. As observed in Figure 3, the second peak of rotavirus diarrhea seems to be driven primarily by the G1P [8] genotype, whereas the fourth peak was mostly driven by G2P [4]. Interestingly, the third peak observed in Figure 3 (81st week) seems to be driven at least partially by G1P [4] and the untypable or partially typable rotavirus genotypes.\\n\\nThe weekly counts of detected rotavirus diarrhea (total 291 episodes) are plotted in a form of a needle-plot and presented in Figure 1. The time series (see Dataset S1) started from week 10, which refers to the beginning of enrollment. The observed average (95% CI) weekly incidence of rotavirus diarrhea was 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks. As expected, the initial weeks of the study had low counts of rotavirus diarrhea due to continuing enrollment. The highest count of rotavirus diarrhea was observed on the 73rd week of the study, which coincides with the end of the enrollment period.\\n\\nThe enrollment scheme is presented in Figure 2, which reflects three segments with characteristic features. Between the 10th and 84th week a steady increase is observed in the child-weeks of follow-up depicting the ongoing enrollment process; between the 84th and 204th week, a practically flat line in the child-weeks of follow-up was observed that denoted the time period when most of the children were being followed-up; thereafter, between 204 and 243rd a rapid decline was observed because of children completing the study. The ageing of the cohort is depicted in Figure 2 as a dashed line.\\n\\nOver the course of the study, the effect of age was found to be the most significant contributor for rotavirus incidence. In one year, a significant reduction of 62.9, 66.6, 60.9, 71.5 percent was observed in the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea and three major genotypes, G1P [8], G2P [4], and G1P [4], respectively (p < 0.0001, see Table 1). The age-specific decline explained 32.1% of the variation in the incidence of rotavirus overall, whereas the seasonality and meteorological factors explained 6.1% of the overall model variation.\\n\\nThe overall rotavirus incidence and for the individual strains assessed, the seasonality remained significant after adjusting for meteorological parameters, and the age and cohort effects. The highest seasonal increase in rotavirus incidence was observed between the 41st and 66th weeks of the study, coinciding with the major bulk of rotavirus diarrhea counts among the study children. This wave peaked at the 54th week when a total of 7 episodes of rotavirus diarrhea were observed over 251.4 child-weeks of follow-up.\\n\\n**Table 1: Model Parameters and Goodness of Fit**\\n|Parameter|Value|\\n|---|---|\\n|b0|Value|\\n|b1|Value|\\n|b2|Value|\\n|b3|Value|\\n|b4|Value|\\n|b5|Value|\\n|b6|Value|\\n|b7|Value|\\n|b8|Value|\\n|b9|Value|\\n|Goodness of Fit|Value|\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\n#\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\n# Figures\\n\\nFigure 1.

We adjusted for age and cohort effects, and assessed the seasonal patterns of rotavirus diarrhea overall and that of three most common genotypes using a Poisson harmonic regression model. After adjusting for strong age effect, seasonal fluctuations remained significant with biannual peaks, 6 months apart. The most pronounced peak was observed during the first winter in the life of the newborn at an average age of about 4 months.\\n\\nBirth cohort studies offer an unbiased approach to examine the relationship between time of birth and susceptibility to infections and have substantial advantages in tracking unique features of specific diseases such as rotavirus where the incidence of symptomatic disease is heavily shifted towards the first few years of life and then diminishes rapidly. It also allows careful tracking of age effects and changes in immunity, and frequency and routes of exposure due to changes during child development including feeding patterns, introduction of weaning foods and changes in hygiene practices.\\n\\nA strong age effect was noticed in this study, with the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea decreasing steadily with increasing age. This is possibly due to the development of protective immunity to rotavirus, which prevented children from developing symptomatic infections at an older age. Natural rotavirus infection has been shown to confer protection against subsequent infection and disease [27,28]. Despite this strong age effect, the detection of seasonal fluctuations in the incidence of rotavirus infection is, on its own, remarkable.\\n\\nThe temporal clustering of the circulating rotavirus genotypes, even within a relatively short time series (Figure 4) was another important finding of this study, and is possibly a result of immune selection pressure. Also, the strain-specific variations in the seasonality of rotavirus observed in this study suggest that the seasonality of rotavirus may be strain-dependent. Therefore, in future studies, including data on the circulating rotavirus genotypes may provide a more robust estimate of the seasonality of rotavirus infection.\\n\\nIt has previously been observed that in temperate climates, the season of birth can adversely affect rotavirus diarrhea and children born in summer have a higher risk of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection that typically peaked in winter [29]. However, unlike in temperate climates, in this study two seasonal peaks of rotavirus diarrhea, 6-months apart, were observed which suggests that children in tropical climates may have the same risk of exposure to the virus, irrespective of their birth season. The staggered enrollment lasted for over one year (Figure 2), thereby enabling children born at different seasons to be equally represented in this study. Hence, it can reasonably be assumed that the effect of seasonality observed in this study was independent of their birth season.\\n\\nCohort studies with an intensive follow-up are difficult to replicate and such in-depth evaluation can be available only for a limited time period, small geographic area and relatively small sample size.

The vertical blue line depicts the predicted incidence derived from the Poisson harmonic regression model.\\n\\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071616.g005\\n\\n# Methodology and Findings\\n\\nTo characterize seasonality, it would be valuable to compile data from similar studies and to pair these data with ongoing community and hospital-based surveillance. The observation of biannual peaks agrees with other studies of rotavirus in tropical climates [17,30,31,32,33]. Published data also provide an illustration of biannual peaks [17].\\n\\nIn a cross-sectional study in Dhaka, a total of 10,739 stool samples from patients admitted between January 2001 to May 2006 in the ICDDR,B hospital were tested for the presence of rotavirus using ELISA-based methods, of which 2706 (25.2%) were found to be positive. A large proportion (>90%) of the rotavirus positive patients were children below the age of 2 years.\\n\\nApplying the harmonic regression model presented in this study, a predictive curve was produced that accounted for 80% of variability in the monthly time series of the proportion of rotavirus positive stool samples (see Figure 6). Although the shift to more severe cases due to differences in patient profiles has to be taken into account while comparing cohort data with community or hospital-based surveillance systems [24], this similarity of biannual peaks observed in the large surveillance sample and our relatively small cohort is encouraging.\\n\\n# Figure 6\\n\\nSeasonality of rotavirus diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2001–2006) with pronounced biannual peaks. The horizontal spikes depict the observed monthly values, the red vertical lines represent the smoothed estimates, and the blue vertical lines reflect the predicted counts based on Poisson harmonic regression model with four sine-cosine terms.\\n\\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071616.g006\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThere is a paucity of data from prospective, community-based studies that measure the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea in Indian children. The majority of studies on rotavirus diarrhea are hospital-based cross-sectional studies. From these studies, the prevalence of rotavirus among hospitalized children was found to be significant.\\n\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org | August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71616\\n---\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nbody {\\nfont-family: Arial, sans-serif;\\nline-height: 1.6;\\nmargin: 20px;\\n}\\nh1 {\\ntext-align: center;\\n}\\nh2 {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\nh3 {\\nmargin-top: 15px;\\n}\\np {\\nmargin: 10px 0;\\n}\\n.references {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\n}\\n.acknowledgments, .author-contributions {\\nmargin-top: 20px;\\nfont-style: italic;\\n}\\n\\n# Rotavirus Seasonality in a Birth Cohort\\n\\nTo range from 19.2–49.9% (average 33.6%). The proportion of diarrhea attributed to rotavirus was, however, much lower at 12% (range 7.1–15.5%) in outpatient settings. Converting our observed weekly incidence of 4.4 (3.7–5.2) episodes per 1000 child-weeks to an annual incidence would have resulted in an average (95% CI) of 0.22 (0.19–0.27) episodes of rotavirus diarrhea per child per year. This is comparable to the rotavirus diarrheal incidence of 0.16 (0.10–0.22) episodes per child-year among <2-year old children in an urban slum in Delhi.\\n\\nWhile birth cohort studies provide highly valuable information to close critical gaps in understanding disease burden, the design of such studies should be also explored as a working platform for investigating the emergence of novel pathogens and strains. In this study, a large number of untypable samples occurred before the switch to another type. Their disproportional increase might indicate the appearance of a new strain previously unknown and not seen for a period of time and not considered for typing. Using a wide range of information sources through triangulation and integration of epidemiological cohorts, surveillance systems, hospitalization records, and outpatient follow-up is a highly promising approach for a better understanding of the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases, tracking the emergence of pathogenic strains, and evaluating the efficacy of intervention programs.\\n\\n# Supporting Information\\n\\n- Dataset S1: Time series of selected variables presented in the study.
